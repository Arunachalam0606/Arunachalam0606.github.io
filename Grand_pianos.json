The location is smack in the middle of Jim Thorpe and a pretty good spot if you're trying to explore the Poconos area. The host was very proactive about their communication and instructions were very clear throughout. We had no issues with the AC at any point (which was a life saver in mid-July) and the 3rd floor offered a great space for us to chill. \n\nI would definitely stay here again if I needed to come back to the area!",

We have 600 acres for you to enjoy hiking, bird watching, biking our trails, kayaking/canoeing our marsh or just finding a quite place on the property to enjoy the outdoors. We also have a non-profit on the property called \"Great Marsh Institute\".",
    "space": "The Glasshouse was originally built in 1953 by Montgomery and Bishop. They were students of Frank Lloyd Wright, the famous architect, designer, writer and educator. The Glasshouse recently underwent a three and a half year renovation and is now ready to welcome you.",
    "access": "The entirety of the upper floor of the Glasshouse is reserved for you. This includes a fully furnished master bedroom with ensuite bathroom, an additional hall bathroom, two furnished bedrooms and an office space. Additionally, there is a fully equipped kitchen, dinning room, and living room with floor to celling glass windows and a cozy gas fireplace. You will also have access to the laundry room downstairs, complete with washer and dryer. We request that you remain on the upper floor as the basement is occasionally used by the family to access storage. However, we want you to feel at home in the Glasshouse, so if need be, we can inform you when we need to enter the basement through a separate entrance. This is a working farm so from time to time we may be driving by the Glasshouse on our UTV’s or tractor to access parts of the property.",

Also some towels smelt like bleach from the jacuzzi. Likely because it's left on the guests to put the towels in laundry before they leave. Unlikely most guests have time to do laundry the morning they need to pack and check out, catch flights etc.  Also with nearly $1000 cleaning fee this shouldn't be asked of the guests to do. So all issues with the house seem to come down to the responsibility of laundering being put on the guests to do. other than this the house was clean, great amenities, plenty of space inside and out. Very pleasant and enjoyable.  Note if you have someone who can't do stairs, the only sleeping option for them is a pull out couch in the living room. All other beds are downstairs or upstairs. We didn't quite understand that, so my Mom had to sleep on the pull out couch, which wasn't really restful  unfortunately.",

I think I was just so nervous about them, the toddlers, running around, I felt like the “House Police”.  The one thing I did do was to invest in covers/throws for those white couches. \n\nNemeh’s was always one step ahead of me. He was very responsive to ANY of my questions.\n\nIt’s a very modern home with lots of smart services. You definitely felt safe here. We also enjoyed the patio and cooking out with family and friends.  Love the extra long dining room table. It was definitely a gathering space.  As the kids continue to grow up and have more grands , I would lived to rent again! Plenty of bedrooms and bathrooms, which was a must for us. \n\nThanks again\n\n\n9.5/10",

We were a little disappointed that we couldn't access the hot tub because it had been winterized like the pool, but that was relatively minor.  A couple of our party were also disappointed that the TV in the family room was not working during our stay, but others were happy to not have a TV on while we were cooking/gathering/playing games there (and there were other TVs those family members could watch)!   The biggest hiccup for the teens/kids was that we couldn't access the internet for several hours after we arrived, but Maria was responsive and helpful in resolving the situation.  \n\nOverall, we enjoyed spreading out in the home and were very comfortable.  During the days, we took the train to DC and did some tourist-y things, but spent our evenings together relaxing at this luxurious home and spending time together.  We'd stay again.",

Exploring the rest of the home is like a vacation within a vacation, as every corner of the home offers something to delight the soul.\n\nUpland was an amazing experience for the entire family, and we are so grateful to Maria for offering her splendid home to us for the holidays.

She made the entire experience easy and seamless! As for the home, it’s beautiful. Beautifully decorated and extremely clean. My family of 10 adults and 3 little grandchildren spent a week here for Thanksgiving and it couldn’t have been better! The house is so spacious and inviting. The kitchen,dining area, and family room was the perfect area for all of us to hang out. The play room upstairs is a great bonus, as well as the gym in the lower level for any adults who want to work out. The pool table/ ping pong table was a hit as well as the movie room! The outside area is beautiful as well. My only regret was that it wasn’t summer so we couldn’t enjoy the pool and outdoor space! The location is perfect as well. On a nice quiet residential street but just minutes from grocery stores and restaurants. We could not have been happier! Thanks again Maria!",

    "summary": "This in-law apartment located in the lower level of my occupied home is just moments outside of Annapolis, mere blocks from the Magothy River.  I enjoy inviting guests into the space, and take pride in treating new friends like family.  Come rest your weary bones in your private retreat with its own separate entrance, relaxing sunporch, and stocked kitchenette.  Reach into the fridge and enjoy cold soda or a local beer on me! Sit around our fireplace and relax. Settle into the Old Bay Bungalow!",
    "space": "This charming space is located in the lower level of my home.  The Old Bay Bungalow is perfect for a couple spending time in the Annapolis area or for a family or friends who wish to visit together.  This beautiful space is both useful and efficient as it comfortably accommodates up to 4 people!  You'll find an opportunity to appreciate the best of the Annapolis area and still be catered to with creature comforts here...without breaking your budget.  Enjoy a peaceful stay in this fully appointed in-law apartment.  The space is separate from the upper level of the home, where I live with my spouse Tom, our children, and a couple of spoiled critters. You'll have easy access to your space via a separate, private entrance located around the rear side of the home off of the back patio, all on one level.  Enjoy your own private bedroom;  you'll find the queen bed is warm and comfortable.  If you choose to invite friends or family members along, the living room's Ikea sleeper sofa quickly converts to a comfortable queen bed complete with fresh, crisp linens for all. Please let me know upon booking if the sofa bed is needed in addition to the private bedroom, and linens will be made available upon said request.  Any additional guests after 2 guests will be an additional $10 per person per night due to the additional bedding needed and subsequent laundry.    Babies, of course, get to slide under the radar and get a free ride!  You will have access to your own full, newly renovated bathroom which is gorgeous.  A flat-screened TV with access to Netflix and Amazon Prime is all yours after a long day exploring the Annapolis area. Through the Fall and Wintertime, the fireplace is stacked with wood and kindling, ready to light.  Your fridge is stocked with complimentary local microbrews, soda, water, plus yogurts for breakfast time.  Your Keurig provides as much hot coffee and tea as you can drink during your stay, and a bowl full of snacks is sure to satisfy any cravings.  If you get hungry for something more, I highly recommend hoofing it down to The Point where fresh seafood and delicious burgers and salads are served.  This local, waterfront gem is less than a 10 minutes walk from this home, and I think it's the perfect place to top off any day. Their happy hour prices are on point! If you have any leftovers, no problem...just stash them in your fridge and heat them up in the space's microwave later.  Curl up at the end of the night with one of the books located in my personal library. If you know how to play the piano, please feel free to tickle the ivory.  Most importantly, make yourself comfortable!",
    "access": "Please make yourself comfortable within your private suite and anywhere within the yard. Please feel free to wander about my garden, and pick anything you’d like when it’s in season!",
    "notes": "1. We live upstairs with both our little human critters as well as our pets.  Your space is separate and our pets will not enter your space. Your space is a dedicated animal-free zone in order to serve those who may have allergies to animals. This is an active family home.  We look forward to meeting you, but we respect your privacy!\n\n2.  There is a pack-and-play located in the closet of the bedroom.  Please feel free to utilize as needed.  Babies and kiddos are welcomed here, and if you need anything to accommodate yours, please let me know.  There is also an iron/ironing board located inside the door of the closet in your living area, along with cleaning supplies. Please feel free to use as needed. \n\n3. I love and support our Military, LEO's, Teachers, and First Responders.  Thank you for all that you do.  Please let me know so I can give you a  discount.  It's the least I can do for those that lay it all down on the line for the rest of us!",
    "neighborhood": "This neighborhood is a laid-back, family-oriented neighborhood located just moments outside of Annapolis. It's quiet (ok, there may be some fireworks on the 4th of July...), and it's a close knit community.  \n\nEnjoy taking a walk around the area and don't miss out on strolling down to the waterfront just blocks from the home.  Locate the key for the private community beach on the mantle above the fireplace.  The private beach provides a gorgeous view.  If you are hungry for a delicious meal or want to make it to Happy Hour, I recommend The Point.  You can choose to walk from our house or make the 1 minute drive!  They have incredible crab cakes, great happy hour eats and treats, and a vast array of beers on tap.  Enjoy!",
    "transit": "Please feel free to park on the street in front of the home.\nYour space is conveniently located approximately 10 minutes outside of Annapolis.  In little more than a few moments drive, you can access everything Annapolis has to offer.  This location allows easy, quick access to all major routes including Route 50 and I-97, for those in need of commuting to Washington DC, Baltimore, and surrounding areas.",
    "interaction": "I have a strong belief that a nice fire pairs well with a hot mug of coffee, steaming tea, or a good brew (generally one at a time...but heck, knock yourself out)!  I am always available via text, message, or phone call.   If you need anything, I am happy to assist you with whatever you may need.  Please never hesitate to contact me.  I can't count how many guests have become truly great friends, and my aim is to make you feel at home during your stay.  Whatever you need, I am happy to accommodate.",
    "house_rules": "1.  This is a smoke-free home.  If you must smoke, please do so outside and dispose of properly in the trash cans outside.  Thanks!\n2.  Be excellent to each other.\n3.  Relax.\n4.  Enjoy yourself!",

It is truly a timeless, tasteful treasure.  \n\nI hope you enjoy this home as much as I do. It is an honor to host you as my guests. \n\n",

With ample parking, this 2600+ sq ft abode exudes cozy charm infused with an industrial-chic vibe. Indulge in a gourmet kitchen, spa-like bathrooms, and comfortable bedrooms. The icing on the cake? A fantastic deck for unforgettable entertaining complete with a tranquil Koi pond.",
    "space": "Prepare to be greeted with warmth and an unmistakable touch of luxury upon your arrival. Quickly you will discover this is no ordinary Airbnb; it is our personal home where we invite you to feel truly at home too, during your stay (without us of course!) Every single furnishing has been carefully selected, sourced from renowned designer labels or as unique antiques. Nothing here is generic or stock.\n\nDiscover an abundance of space, offering ample room to unwind and relax. The living room boasts a beautiful Arhaus tufted sectional, complemented by a cozy gas fireplace and a 70-year-old grand piano. Fresh flowers add a touch of elegance, while the large dining table invites shared meals and memorable conversations. The comfortable beds, along with an available air mattress, ensure a restful night's sleep. Indulge in relaxation with a slipper tub and a rejuvenating spa shower, conveniently accompanied by a washer and dryer located upstairs.\n\nLuxuriate in plush linens that envelop you in comfort, enhanced further by memory foam mattress toppers. High-end toiletries are thoughtfully provided for your convenience. Throughout the space, tasteful art adds a touch of aesthetic appeal, and an abundance of books and games await your perusement and play in the attic lounge.\n\nTo enhance your experience, we have the fastest Wi-Fi available for this area, and a Bluetooth sound system allows you to link your phone and enjoy your favorite music. Immerse yourself in the world of vinyl with a modern turntable. The convenience of four Amazon \"Alexas\" placed strategically throughout the home ensures effortless assistance (easy to turn off if desired). Each of the four flat-screen TVs are equipped with popular streaming apps, allowing you to sign in and enjoy your preferred entertainment.\n\nFor coffee and tea lovers, a selection of beverages awaits your indulgence. Instant hot water and Reverse Osmosis water from the sink provide added convenience. The kitchen is equipped with top-of-the-line All-Clad and Le Creuset cookware, alongside a Vitamix blender, air fryer, and Cuisinart food processor, amongst many other gourmet kitchen tools.\n\nStep outside onto the deck, where outdoor dining and relaxing evenings beckon, including an invitation to relax next to our Koi pond. An umbrella provides dining shade, and the sectional gives ample seating. For those who enjoy grilling, an outside gas grill and dining area are at your disposal. \nInside, a revolving pantry and a stocked fridge with popular condiments ensure you lack for nothing during your stay.\n\nRest assured, every detail has been considered to ensure your comfort and satisfaction. Stay with us and experience a warm welcome that will exceed your expectations.",
    "access": "You have access to entire house, minus the basement which is where I store my personal belongings, and the detached garage which will be locked. There might be a small locked hauling trailer on property behind garage, out of your way.",
    "notes": "This is my personal home. Respect is expected. I am a seasoned Airbnb host that has seen it all. I maintain the right to deny any booking request I don’t believe fits this listing, and if negligence or unreasonable damage is present after your departure, I will proceed with a financial claim. I have rarely had to do this, thankfully.\n\nWith that being said, I do NOT charge a cleaning fee, pet fee, and do not ask you to do any “chores” at checkout outside of common sense. When I travel, I want to relax, so I want that for you too.\n\nEarly check-in and/or late check-out can be prearranged at $25 per hour, for up to 5 hours in either direction. Please be courteous and prompt with designated check out times, as my cleaning crew will be waiting to start.\n\nDue to experience, there will be a $50 extra fee if confetti is NOT cleaned up upon departure. It’s extremely difficult to clean (it sticks to everything) and my cleaning crew is delayed when turning over the property. Please just stick with balloons and streamers like the good ‘ol days. :)\n\nI host a revolving pantry with my guests. This means there might be condiments and unused food (not expired) in the refrigerator, freezer, or pantry. Feel free to use what you wish, and leave what you can’t take.\n\nUse caution in attic. Not recommended for small children unattended. No railings installed.\n\nNo open fire/flames allowed outside (fire pit, etc) No parties or events allowed.\n\nLawn is mowed by a landscaping company every Friday from April to November.\n\nContact me for special event rates. This house is the perfect size for a baby or bridal shower, or other intimate gatherings.",

The way the light from the windows enters the space is magical- the entire home is more beautiful in reality than even the photos. Charles and Abigail are wonderful hosts- very responsive and easy to communicate with and so friendly!! We felt so welcome. We loved the thoughtful touches- the coffee, the well stocked fridge, the toiletries in the bathroom, and toys in the piano room! Our toddler had an absolute blast and didn’t want to leave. This space is very comfortable for travel with a child- the layout is perfect, our toddler wandered all over without an issue. He loved the yogurt in the fridge! And was able to start his day with an egg too :) the beds and linens are crisp and clean, and the whole home smells amazing! If we ever come back to Reading, this is where we will always stay hands down. A perfect home away from home. Thank you again!",

When we discovered this listing that also had the opportunity to rent their car, I knew it was perfect.  We stayed for the car but loved it for all the details and wonderful hosts.  Charles and Abigail thought of everything.  I enjoyed the electric shades, Alexa integrated lights, smart tv, wonderful hot shower with great pressure and very comfortable beds. After visiting New York for a few days we felt like we had made it to a home away from home.  Not only was everything perfect, the hosts were proactive in making sure our stay was the best possible. They communicated quickly and were some of the best hosts we’ve had. You won’t regret your stay.",

And a Keurig Special Edition coffee maker for expressos, americanos, or other milk creations!",
    "space": "Although this is an apartment in a larger building, the rest of the building is still being remodeled and you will not be interacting with other guests. We designed this apartment to be open, welcoming, and trendy! Light streams in the huge windows during the day, and custom touches like the exposed brick and original flooring remind you of the factory that this building was.  There is not off street parking, but our street often has parking, and there is a school across the street who’s parking lot can be used during the off hours. You will not have access to the rest of the building.\n\nWe are very pleased to now offer a 2021 Tesla model Y rental in conjuncture with your stay! If you book this vehicle it comes with free indoor parking and 100% free supercharging at public chargers and free high speed overnight charging. So you will not have any fuel expenses at all! Please message me prior to your stay to check availability and then after you book I will coordinate with you for your discount to rent it on Turo. \n\nIf you are flying into Philadelphia airport we may be able to either pick you up at the airport or arrange delivery of the car at the terminal, depending on our schedule $125 each way. \n\nWe offer discounts for combined stay and car rent.  And discounts for longer stays.\n\nCar rental prices:\n2 days minimum $99 per day\n7 days or more $75 per day\n30 days or more $50 per day\n\nhttps://turo.com/us/en/suv-rental/united-states/reading-pa/tesla/model-y/906900",
    "access": "You will have access to the entire apartment, but not to any areas of the rest of the building.",
    "notes": "We do live in the city so there could be some related noises, to assist you we offer complimentary earplugs and a sound machine. But overall it is fairly quiet. Also we have a zero tolerance policy on parties. Only the people mentioned on the reservation may enter.",
    "neighborhood": "We live in the city, so there is the normal amount of city noise, although our apartment is away from the street and pretty quiet! We are surrounded by a church and a school, which really helps it feel like a nice atmosphere. As in any city, we don’t recommend anything unsafe such as traipsing around the streets alone in the middle of the night.   We are near the Santander arena, and several lovely restaurants we would love to recommend to you!",
    "interaction": "We live in a different apartment in the Factory and should be available to greet you and answer any questions. We will also be available through messaging!",
    "house_rules": "No parties please. Only the people on your reservation are allowed inside. Please message me if you would like an exception. \nAlso absolutely no drugs are allowed on the property, please respect this. Thanks:)",

It was super private with amazing views (especially the sunsets from the patio/gazebo).  The house was huge, and there was plenty of room for everyone to have their own space but also lots of room to socialize. It's really a great venue for a family gathering or reunion. We really enjoyed our stay and would consider going back next year.",

It was super private with amazing views (especially the sunsets from the patio/gazebo).  The house was huge, and there was plenty of room for everyone to have their own space but also lots of room to socialize. It's really a great venue for a family gathering or reunion. We really enjoyed our stay and would consider going back next year.",

The space itself is unique and simply charming to marvel at. With all the running around for wedding activities, we did not get a chance to spend more time in the space or explore Cat's recommended list of things to do so we would love to come back. And certainly recommend to others looking for a unique stay in a beautiful location.",

She had also stocked the well-equipped kitchen with much-appreciated eggs, butter, milk, granola, juice, and fruit, in addition to coffee,  tea, and a tray of condiments and spices. The cottage was very comfortable, and I felt at home immediately. It's location also made it very easy to explore parts of Waterford on foot. I highly recommend and look forward to returning!",

    "summary": "Grace Cottage has been expertly re-designed to be a unique studio-style living space. It has one California king bed, a living area, large library, dining area and a fully-stocked kitchen space with a stove (no oven). There are also two sofa beds and a grand piano ~ a wonderful place to explore Waterford, the surrounding vineyards, and an opportunity to stay in one of the village's beautifully preserved properties.",
    "space": "There is a dining area that seats and is equipped with service for 6. The kitchen has everything but an oven and is fully equipped for cooking and making coffee & cappuccino, pasta, and a glorious breakfast. The ceilings are 15' high and the bathroom has new fixtures and a glass door shower. There is central air and heat. There are two sitting areas and a desk, as well as about 1,000 books to choose from!",
    "access": "Guests are given the entire use of Grace Cottage. \n\nUnfortunately, due to the pandemic, we can only allow registered guests on the property. If you have someone who may visit but not spend the night, please be sure to include them in your guest count.",
    "notes": "The Village of Waterford is 1 of only 2 places in the America where the entire village is listed as a National Historic Landmarks, for good reason. You will know it when you arrive, until then, check out \"Waterford Village . org\" (all one word, the site hides URLs).",
    "neighborhood": "A complete walking guide through Waterford, a National Historic Landmark, is left for you in Grace Cottage. For a fabulous hike to a charming little waterfall within the village, look no further than Phillips Farm ~ a gorgeous walk through preserved lands surrounding the Village, ending in a beautiful waterfall. Grace Cottage is a 5 minute walk to Village Winery which makes lovely wine and the very best Elderberry and Aronia non-alcholic juices. There is a neighborhood pool on Clarks Gap Road, on the way out of the village. Anyone can swim for a guest fee of $5/person. There is also a farm stand with organic fruits and veggies, freshly baked bread and eggs, in front of the Waterford Market on Second Street every Saturday from 9-11am during spring, Summer and Fall.",
    "transit": "There are two (if creative 3) parking spots on the property for guests.  If additional parking is necessary please let me know as street parking along Main Street is respectfully reserved for home owners by village residents. Many will kindly offer up their space if requested, but I will need to request their indulgence.",
    "interaction": "I am happy to offer recommendations for places to visit, dine and hike nearby, and answer any questions at any time during your stay.",
    "house_rules": "Please leave the Cottage the way you found it. Please don't move the furniture - unless using the pullout beds,  in which case, please be mindful of the antique pieces as well as the original wood floors as they scratch quite easily and we take note of their condition before guest arrival.\n\nThough we have a wood fire stove in the Cottage, unfortunately a previous guest nearly set the home on fire by abusing the right to set a fire in my wood stove, and sadly, my insurance company required that I now have to dis-allow use. However. the air conditioning and heat work perfectly, just be sure to reset the thermostat to 70 degrees upon your departure.\n\nAs a reminder, your rate covers 2 guests but Grace Cottage can accommodate a maximum number of 6 guests for the additional fee per guest. Unfortunately, due to the pandemic we can only allow registered guests on the property. If you have someone who may visit but not spend the night, please be sure to include them in your guest count.",

We dealt primarily with David, who is a co-host, and he was very attentive and helpful with anything we needed or wanted to know.  We had a hiccup with the AC and David was there immediately to get everything working and keep it that way.  He even delivered us farm-fresh eggs one morning!  \nSuch a unique home and wonderful area - I’d be happy to go back anytime.",

Hosts were Elizabeth’s parents; David and his wife were so good and kind to us. It was perfect farmhouse experience with goats, chickens, ducks, fishes, ponds, bon fire and awesome landscape. Although it was raining most of the time, but we did had fun. My two-year daughter along with other kids thought David was Old MacDonald and they were enjoying moments like petting and feeding animals and birds. \n\nWe thought of cookout but because of weather we had to cook inside, kitchen was well equipped. We had everything we need. David and his wife were awesome hosts. We would like to come back and also recommend this to others.",

    "summary": "Quaker colonial (circa 1753) on small farm with free range goats, chickens, ducks, rabbits, and other animals.  Ballenger farm is close to wineries, breweries, horse and hunt country, the WD&O bike trail, and the Appalachian trail.",
    "space": "The farm is accessed via a private natural road. The property includes a barn, spring house, corn crib, and several streams and ponds. Outside, you can roam the property and visit ducks, chickens, rabbits, and fainting goats; take in the view from the deck;  enjoy the fish ponds (fishing allowed); and walk several trails. Looking to grill? Go back in time with an old fashion fire pit, wood fired grill, and five foot deep in-ground oven.\n\nInside, the vibe is very \"East meets West mid 1700s\" with a mix of classy antiques, funky vintage finds, and East Asian pieces.  In addition to the bathrooms and bedrooms, there is a living room. piano room that looks into the courtyard, dining room that sits up to 12, large kitchen with two ovens and six burner gas cook top, laundry/mud room, and special toy room accessed by a winding stair.",
    "access": "The home includes an original stone section first started in the mid-1700s with a brick section added later. The entire stone section is open to guests, and has it's own private entry. \n\nBallenger Farm is a working hobby farm. We raise chickens, ducks, rabbits, and goats. Feel free to roam the property - there is a mile of trails for walking. However, not all the buildings have been fully restored so they are not safe for adventuring in, especially for children.",
    "notes": "> Ballenger Farm has no check-out Airbnb chores.  Enjoy your stay!\n\n> The goats and other farm animals are friendly and like to investigate new folks. You can toss the chickens and ducks all kinds of snacks and feed the goats out of your hand :).  Please encourage children to move slowly as quick movements can frighten the animals.\n\n> Cars should be parked behind the barns. When cars are parked near the house (which is the goats favorite space) the goats like to play king of the mountain on top of them. \n\n> Stays at Ballenger are limited to eight adults plus several children under 10 years.\n\n> Per Airbnb policy, we do not host parties, events, or other gatherings via the Airbnb platform.\n\n> Please note: my parents live and work on the farm in the brick section that is attached to the main stone house in which you will be staying. There are no shared entrances or indoor spaces. \n\n> Some guests have said that they think that Ballenger has ghosts. We have not seen or heard any. Instead, we think that after 270 years, any house can  be forgiven its quirks and creaks. :)\n\n> Airbnb AI claims that this property is a '10 minute walk from a lake'. There are no lakes of any size in the entire county. Hosts can not change this. Airbnb suggested that I add this note to this listing until they can fix the bug.",
    "neighborhood": "Ballenger Lane is an 18th century natural road with only two other houses and neither are visible from the property giving Ballenger Farm exceptional privacy for the area.\n\nHorse and Hunt Country, the Appalachian Trail, the Shenandoah and Potomac Rivers, Harper's Ferry, and dozens of wineries and breweries are within a 10 to 30 minute radius.\n\nPurcellville is next door. It has quaint shops with vintage goods as well as convenient grocery stores and resturants.\n\nA walking path connects Ballenger Farm to Patrick Henry College. If you have relatives, friends, or business there, it makes it a very quick commute!",
    "transit": "A DC commuter bus departs from a free parking lot 8 minutes away.\n\nDulles Airport is about 30 minutes away.\n\nLyft and Uber are available, but wait times can be a bit longer than in urban areas. Limos are popular for wine tours, but make sure to book in advance.\n\nMetro's Silver Line is 40 minutes away, but opening much closer in 2023.",
    "interaction": "In Covid times you’re able to stay here free of any interaction with me and my cohost parents. You can reach us by phone if you need anything! Also, since the farm is owned by my darling parents you might see us working outside- and we'll probably give a little wave.",
    "house_rules": "Please,  no additional overnight guests. The overnight accommodations are for eight adults/children (additional infants and toddlers that sleep in bassinets or pack n plays are most welcome!).\n\nThe speed limit on Ballenger Lane is 5 mph. It used to be the main North/South road in Western Loudoun back when Ballenger Farm was first established 270 years ago. And now it's in the same condition as it was then! A one lane natural road with washes and pot holes! Please drive carefully and all will be OK.",

The house sits next door to a museum that has a lovely garden so there is a feeling of urban privacy. The hosts have really thought about the details - any kitchen gadget we could want for, loads of fluffy towels and wine glasses, lovely air conditioning, the music was playing when we arrived and gorgeous flowers sprinkled about. My family were in town to attend my fathers funeral, so it was a difficult and emotional week, but the house gave us refuge and space to meet with relatives and friends we hadn't seen in many years. My mother had a private suite where she could rest away from the family. This helped her face the week greatly. We are just in awe of the house design and the thoughtfulness of our hosts (even fresh donuts under glass...). The upgraded tech was greatly appreciated. I love PoshAbodes!!",

Alexandria is a beautiful area and also so close to DC and Mount Vernon.  The little extras are abundant and appreciated.   From fresh flowers to a literally endless supply of giant fluffy white towels and bath robes, we simply felt well taken care of.   The kitchen is well stocked and every room is well lit - great lighting.  Family room is cozy and primary bed is very comfortable.  The front office is an amazing space if you need to work - desk with USB's, outlets and a view.\nGreat supply of the basics that we don't find in every rental home such as garbage bags, ziplock bags, toilet paper, Q tips and toiletries - stocked like a 5 star hotel.  These little things mean ALOT when traveling.   When I asked the kids about their favorite part of the trip to DC (we toured 1-2 things daily), they said:  The house!!",

Check in was easy-- quiet, private parking spots, remote keyless entry, and even champagne! The historical architectural features, the décor, the high quality furniture, and the original artwork are really above and beyond-- some days we didn’t even want to leave the house! We were also able to spread out in the various rooms comfortably. The kitchen had professional grade appliances and anything we could need to prepare a meal. The master bedroom was large, with a very comfortable bed and bedding, and the blackout curtains and location on the next door private garden afforded us excellent sleep-- not something I usually can count on while traveling! The master bathroom was perfect-- large dressing room, huge shower and separate bath made dressing easy-- and fluffy towels upon extra fluffy towels! We will definitely return!",

    "summary": "Delight in every sumptuous detail at Hobson Hall, a truly unique four-bedroom, 3.5-bathroom stunner, comprising more than 3,600 square feet of space. One of the few remaining Richardsonian Romanesque houses left in Alexandria, Hobson Hall is located adjacent to Lee-Fendall House Museum & Gardens, an elegant event venue and popular setting for weddings. Settle in and enjoy a one-of-a-kind dwelling imbued with historic charm and ultra-luxe amenities. When you’re ready to venture out, all of Old Town Alexandria’s renowned shops, museums, and dining establishments are just steps away.   \n  \nEquipped to accommodate up to 12 guests, Hobson Hall boasts so much more than your average vacation rental, such as two living rooms, a luxe master suite, gas fireplaces, and a chic parlor complete with a baby grand piano. It’s ideal for events, celebrations, holidays, and reunions.   \n  \nBuilt circa 1896, this home underwent a major renovation overseen by local architect James Palmer, yet it still retains many of its original architectural elements, such as doors, hardware, arched entry doors, fireplaces and their tilework and mantels, and all the windows visible from Washington Street. Hobson Hall is owned by a local artist who was recently awarded a residency at the Torpedo Factory Art Center in Alexandria. You’ll see many of her beautiful original paintings on display throughout the home.   \n  \nAbout this Property  \nArchitect Henry Hobson Richardson pioneered the Richardson Romanesque Revival Style, which incorporates 11th and 12th-century southern French, Spanish and Italian Romanesque characteristics. You’ll find charming details around every corner, from the dramatic arched doors in the vestibule to the brick adorning several fireplaces.   \n  \nAs you enter Hobson Hall, you’ll be greeted by this home’s elegant living spaces. Beautiful marble tile makes a dramatic statement in the vestibule. After entering through arched double doors, you’ll find the home’s formal living spaces nearby — a formal living room, an intimate parlor, and a study. The study features sophisticated dark colors and views onto Washington Street, and comes complete with a desk and printer.  \n  \nHead down the hallway boasting beautiful hardwood floors to reach the gourmet open kitchen and its adjacent living spaces, including a large family room and dining area, all of which can be closed off from the front of the house thanks to a large pocket door. The chef’s kitchen is equipped with a professional, eight-burner gas range with double ovens and a pot filler, as well as a large island with waterfall countertop. A stylish wet bar with a wine fridge adds convenience.   \n  \nStep out onto the lovely brick patio to enjoy views of the impressive gardens of Lee-Fendall House Museum & Gardens. Outfitted with patio furniture, a fire table, and a gas grill, this is the perfect place to relax and enjoy the vistas.   \n  \nHead to the second level to discover four richly appointed bedrooms. The luxurious master bedroom features crown molding, sophisticated lighting, a large walk-in closet, and an ensuite bathroom with a tiled shower, separate soaking tub, and double sinks. In the king guest bedroom, you’ll find a gorgeous bay window, as well as chic décor blending neutrals with pops of vibrant color. The third guest bedroom boasts a canopy bed, a soothing color scheme, and its own ensuite bathroom. And finally, in the fourth bedroom, there’s a queen bed along with a twin trundle bed, plus private entrance to the hallway bathroom. Each guest room features high-end bedding, bedside USB ports, TVs, and eye-catching touches that make you feel at home.   \n  \nWhy Choose This Alexandria Vacation Home   \n• Unbeatable location just four blocks from Old Town’s King Street and six blocks to the waterfront  \n• Adjacent to the historic Lee-Fendall House Museum & Garden  \n• Two dedicated off-street parking spaces  \n• Close to a wide array of restaurants, shops, parks, landmarks, and museums  \n• Historic abode with modern comforts  \n• Brand-new full-sized washer and dryer  \n• Impressive amenities, luxe touches, and high-tech features  \n• Walkability score of 95  \n• Poshabodes’ rigorous COVID-19 cleaning and disinfection protocols  \n  \nRecommended Spots Nearby   \nLee-Fendall House Museum & Garden — 1-minute walk  \nThe Rectory on Princess Street — 2-minute walk  \nTrader Joe’s — 4-minute walk  \nLe Refuge Restaurant — 4-minute walk  \nOld Hat Bar — 6-minute walk  \nMurphy’s Grand Irish Pub – 6-minute walk  \nKing’s Ransom — 7-minute walk  \nThe Rub Chicken & Beer — 7-minute walk  \nVillage Brauhaus — 8-minute walk  \nGadsby’s Tavern — 8-minute walk  \nMomo Sushi & Café — 8-minute walk  \nFounders Park — 8-minute walk  \nHank’s Oyster Bar — 8-minute walk  \nOld Town Farmers Market – 10-minute walk  \nThe Warehouse — 10-minute walk\n\nAlexandria Visitor Center – 11-minute walk  \nTwo Nineteen – 11-minute walk  \nLandini Brothers Restaurant – 12-minute walk  \nTorpedo Factory Art Center — 12-minute walk  \nOronoco Bay Park — 12-minute walk  \nVola’s Dockside Grill and Hi-Tide Lounge — 12-minute walk  \nWashington Monument – 13-minute drive  \nLincoln Memorial – 11-minute drive  \nNational Gallery of Art – 15-minute drive  \nArlington National Cemetery – 11-minute drive  \nSmithsonian National Museum of Natural History – 12-minute drive  \n  \nIncluded with Every Poshabodes Property:   \n• Pristinely clean home  \n• Well-appointed kitchen  \n• Dedicated Poshconcierge to help curate your perfect trip  \n• Upscale living amenities, including luxury bedding, robes, slippers, towels and toiletries  \n• 24x7 access to Poshabodes Customer Care Team  \n• Virtual home guidebook with details about the home and the surrounding area  \n  \nOptional Features* (contact your Poshconcierge for more information)  \n• Early check-in / late check-out  \n• Daily housekeeping  \n• Personal chef services  \n• Car service / car rental / chauffeur  \n• Airport transfers  \n  \n*available at an additional cost",

    "neighborhood": "Old Town Alexandria  \nWith a history spanning more than 250 years, this delightful town still bears many hallmarks of its fascinating past. Old Town is packed with museums and landmarks that make you feel like you’ve stepped aboard a time machine. Its narrow, cobblestone streets are lined with centuries-old row homes, and European-inspired storefronts along main thoroughfares such as King Street are a treat for the eyes. Dine in locally owned eateries and shop at independent retailers — the choices are seemingly endless. There’s no better time to experience the magic of Old Town than during the holidays, when buildings are decked out in glittering lights and seasonal décor.  \n  \nWashington, DC  \nThe nation’s capital is the cultural and historic heartbeat of the nation, and with around 70 museums, it’s a prime spot for curious, knowledge-seeking travelers. After a visit to the Washington or Lincoln monuments, explore buzzy neighborhoods like Capitol Hill, H Street Corridor, or Dupont Circle, where eateries and bars bring together the local crowd. Performance venues and arts organizations scattered throughout town showcase American art and music in all its forms. To appreciate natural beauty, head to one of the many parks dotting the landscape, including Rock Creek Park and Glover Archbold Park, or settle in near Georgetown Waterfront Park overlooking the Potomac River.",

The rest of the house is classic and original. The house is close to 322, so you can hear traffic. But not too much. Still felt private and rural. We really enjoyed our time on the back porch with the fire table. Our family group of 10 enjoyed our stay. Thanks to Binky for opening up this beautiful piece of history for us.",

    "summary": "Experience this historic 1700's Mansion with more fireplaces than I can count!\n\nThis house is a bit unusual, it is 300 years old, originally a small Quaker home, and even has an interesting story attached to it as it grew and expanded from a 400 square foot foot-print to an 8,000 square foot mansion.\n\nThe original house was built in the 1600s as a Quaker plan house. The British burned it to the ground in 1777 before it was rebuilt.\n\nNot everything is in working order. Fend for yourself!",

They provide coffee and home made grab and go treats, which makes my morning commute easy as I don’t need to stop for coffee or breakfast.  I think their motto should be “Mi casa es tu casa” as I always feel right at 🏡 home. 😃",

Had my coffee out there every morning. The house is well appointed; I had everything I needed. Elizabeth is very responsive and a wonderful host- truly a gem! Book this place- you won’t be disappointed",

Wonderful, cozy accommodations, one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in, well-stocked with absolutely everything thought of and available for a comfortable stay.  Impeccably clean.  Perfect location in the middle of it all for walking to restaurants, the marina, the canal & just for people watching from the front porch.  My son plays piano and absolutely loved the opportunity to play on the baby grand every day.   I appreciated the nice work space too.  Great wi-fi and wide range of streaming options too.  I would highly recommend the Bohemia Bungalow.  :)",

It was so nice to be able to have the quick walk down the street. Cute shops in the area (good chocolate across the street ;). We loved the space so much we just showed the photos of the Bungalow to our interior decorator. We would like to incorporate some of the feel of this into our own home. Just to mention again we give A++ on cleanliness. We also loved the journal of notes from the guests. Elizabeth was great and so responsive!  If we go back to this event we will defiantly be rebooking the  Bohemia Bungalow!",

      "about": "Just a short note before you book... Recently we have made some hosting changes due to co hosting changes. We have gone back to having myself and John cohost. My sister is also helping us. We have found our more mature ages to work better in caring for our listings. We have removed all non family or younger co hosts  in an effort to better serve our guests. \nBare with us we are in the midst of a spruce up in two locations. We are painting and updating. Please be patient some times its a bit messy with building materials. We are almost done with our changes.\n  PLEASE note there is a three hour time difference between West coast and East coast. We are three hours ahead of you please be advised if you inquire at 10 pm western time we are asleep on the east coast. Europe is six hours ahead of us respectfully. Please be aware you will wake me up, keeping that in mind its important when inquiring to do it before 11 eastern standard time. I'm not trying to be rude just a reminder.\nI want to welcome each guest either in person, by text or over the phone. I work out of state but I try to get down to beach listing several times per week. My son lives in our home in Felton all the time. His name is Julian. He's the typical game loving 21 year old. We are improving the house a little at a time by ourselves. I'm a designer and work in interior sales. We keep our dog with us all the time. We are dog people, animal lovers. We allow people the ability to stay and travel with pets. Our Dog lives on the farm up north where we work so no dogs live in the house in Felton. There are always dogs at Greenwood street. We keep stuff at our homes. We ask guests to read our house rules because I feel we live such busy lives its a necessity so our guests understand our reasons for what we expect. We are doing Airbnb to offer alternatives to hotels. We are simple unadorned folks. If you book with us there will be clean towels,  sheets and soap. \n Nothing fancy. If your looking for fancy that's not us. \nWe are available on What's AP for international communication. ",

The unit is directly off the Circle and is 1 block from the 14th street corridor: Whole Foods, Starbucks, CVS, and multiple bars/restaurants on every block. The city`s trendiest bars and restaurants have located along 14th Street and the U Street Corridor - both within easy walking distance - so it`s the perfect location for a nice dinner or to enjoy a night on the town.

And Jocelyn’s place was perfect for our needs - close to where our aging parents and extended family live in Gaithersburg and Rockville and very conveniently located walking distance to the Kentland shops - Whole Foods etc., The place was perfect for our needs as we had space for both of our families 1) parent and child in the downstairs apartment and 2) family of 4 and our nanny in the unit above. Both are very well connected and the layout of the house provided ample privacy yet plenty of space to hang out and catch up - play board games and have long simple meals over the holidays. Kids loved watching sports and movies in the living room and the grand piano was a fun festive addition. Jocelyn was an excellent host answering all of our questions about space and layout and being super responsive in addressing any minor issues that came up. We hope to come back for another extended stay when visiting family in the area.",

We could not have picked a more perfect place.\n\nThe house is enormous, pristine, and beautifully appointed, with ample room for guests to enjoy their privacy or time together in the numerous common areas, including a basement full of games and the largest home movie theater I've ever seen.\n\nAs beautiful as the house is on the inside, so are the views and grounds. On the same mountain, less than a mile away, there is a brewing company that is now possibly my favorite outdoor dining venue. The view to the east from there is breathtaking, attracting literally hundreds on any sunny day. Our home offered every bit as spectacular a view, but looking to the gorgeous valley and mountains to the west, and with the utmost of privacy. Almost too stunning to believe.\n\nDavid is a kind and generous host who couldn't have been more helpful during our stay.\n\nBook more days than you were planning if you can - you won't regret it!",

It is a beautiful home - spacious, well laid out, meticulously maintained - with SO much to do in the home and around the property. \n\nThere was something for everyone...a huge rope swing which was endlessly entertaining for the kids (plus foosball and ping pong indoors) and a fire pit with Adirondack chairs for the adults. The indoor movie theater was a hit for the entire crew. There is also a nice easy hiking trail on the property as well as a public trail just up the road which offers incredible views. Middleburg, VA is about 30 mins away and has lots of shops/restaurants and a great brewery (Lost Barrel) with tons of outdoor space - great for a day trip. \n\nThe host, David, was such a pleasure to work with - very responsive, extremely knowledgable about the area, and immediately available for any questions that came up during our stay.",

    "notes": "A rental contract is required for every booking and will be sent to guests within the 48-hour zero penalty cancellation period.\n\nPlease be aware that the historic General Store has a back staircase with uneven stairs, which may not be suitable for guests with mobility issues. We recommend guests with such considerations to take note of this before booking.\n\nCOVID-19 Update: The safety and well-being of our guests are our top priorities. Prior to check-in, we kindly request that all guests answer screening questions regarding COVID-19 exposure or symptoms.\n\nPet Policy: We welcome well-behaved dogs! We recommend ensuring your dog is up to date on flea/tick medication prior to their stay. To maintain cleanliness, we kindly ask that all dogs remain off the furniture at all times, even those that are considered \"non-shedding.\" When left alone in the house, we request that you crate your pet. If you plan to bring your pet, please inform us at the time of booking. A pet fee of $100 per pet per stay will apply.\n\nAlthough the property is conveniently located near various amenities, it is also nestled in Lancaster County's renowned farms and fields. Please be aware that you may encounter some wildlife, such as ladybugs, stinkbugs, deer, turkeys, bees, wasps, frogs, moths, ticks, spiders, bats, snakes, etc., during your stay. Our dedicated housekeepers and pest control service work diligently to maintain cleanliness and tidiness. However, as the property is centuries old and situated in the countryside, the occasional encounter with wildlife or the scent of nearby farms is possible.",

    "house_rules": "AGE 25 OR OLDER TO BOOK: The guest booking the property must be 25 years of age or older. The guest who books must stay at the property--you may not book for others if you do not intend to stay at the property.\n\nPETS: - As pet lovers ourselves, we welcome canine guests with responsible owners with advance permission. Dogs must be housebroken, well-behaved, and pest-free. A flat $100 pet fee will be assessed for each pet per stay.\n\nWOOD STOVES: You are encouraged to use the wood stoves as long as you do so carefully. The stove can get very hot, so be sure to keep small children away whenever a fire is burning. Do not use the stove during windy or dry conditions. You MUST use the provided fireplace screen or keep the doors shut while the stove is in use.\n\nFURNITURE - Do not move the furniture, as this increases the likelihood of damaging something. Loss of any items or damage to furnishings will result in additional charges and/or loss of your security deposit.\n\nPELOTON BIKE+:  Children under the age of 14 are not permitted to use the Peloton Bike+.  All others use the bike at their own risk.\n\nBUGS: This is a house in the farmland of Pennsylvania - that means there are lots of bugs, especially in the summertime. Even if you are careful some of those bugs will find their way into the house. The best way to minimize the number of bugs inside is to keep doors and windows closed at all times.\n\nSMOKING: Smoking is never allowed inside the house.

If traveling with kids, bring games, books, activities as there is nothing besides the TV to keep them entertained in your downtime. Overall, good spot to stay and could be great with some TLC and attention to detail.",

He left us well stocked with wood pellets and firewood, and called on the first day to make sure we knew how to run the pellet stove (pro tip: don't leave the lid open longer than 60 seconds). His home is really well situated. It's minutes from the GW Parkway, I-495, and Mclean proper, making it convenient to get places. Even with that, it's very quiet/private: your only visitors will be foxes and roving mobs of deer who are wholly unafraid of you. There are some beautiful views from the giant windows all over the house. \n\nThe flip side to those giant windows is that it can get a little nippy when it's cold but that's where the fireplace and stove come in. All in all, this is a wonderful home for a family or private getaway. Five stars.",

I was at first a little bit hesitant about staying in a basement with a party of 7 but as soon as we arrived our 4-year-old granddaughter was in heaven playing in the children's playroom, the basement is nicer and roomier than I even hoped for.  The teenage grandkids were a little bummed that there was no TV but we seldom see them that they aren't staring at their phones anyhow. We would have loved to spend more time at this property but between the wedding rehearsal and the wedding it's self we were on a limited time schedule, but it was so peaceful sitting outside enjoying a cup of coffee in the morning. Amos is great at keeping in touch and more than willing to make sure you are happy with your stay. If you're looking for peaceful getaway this, is it.",

The architectural detail pays homage to a bygone era while seamlessly integrating modern luxury comforts and touches. The kitchen is the hearth of the home and so inviting…perfect place for wine after dinner before hanging in the family room with a grand piano. Even if you cannot cook or play the piano, this place makes you feel as though you could win a James Beard award and moonlight in the national symphony. The grounds are gorgeous and mature with grapevines, tiger lilies and a pear tree.  \n\nEvery inch has been carefully curated and designed, you can feel the love that was poured into making this place a perfect gem. \n\nLeigh is a generous and gracious host, every thing you want and hope for. It’s perfect for kids, pet friendly, lots of natural light. Highly recommend. 5 stars times infinity!!! ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️",

And has so many thoughtful touches like hooks just in perfect places, more towels than you need, extra blankets, USB ports by the beds, every item you could need in the kitchen and quality dishes and utensils...the list goes on and on. The kitchen and bathrooms are beautifully done with tiles and cabinets. The central AC worked wonderfully, the seating on the porch, living-room, kitchen was perfect, everything was just perfect! The hosts were incredibly responsive with a great welcome guide with all kinds of helpful info. I've traveled all over the world staying in airbnbs and other similar companies as well as hotel apartments etc. and this home might be the nicest place I ever stayed. Well done!",

We also love historic homes so it was extra special to see all the work they have done to restore the property. The kitchen was fully stocked with all the tools we needed to make family meals, as well as a cute coffee station. We ventured out to the Turkey Hill Experience to sample ice cream, and had a lovely walk and lunch in downtown Lancaster, both a short drive away. You won't need to plan ahead when visiting, as Leigh provides an extensive guide of things to do and local amenities.",

This was the perfect place to relax and unwind after a very hectic pace. \n\nWe were in town for a basketball tourney. This was an easy 15-minute ride to Spooky Nook. But far away from the hectic craziness that 700 teams playing all weekend creates. \n\nWe're seasoned Superhosts and Leigh puts us to shame, her guidebook is great, she leaves lovely little local surprises, and there's a peaceful, relaxed decadence about this Stone Home. \n\nBest of all, while being a pet- friendly place, there was NO evidence of animals or dust-- its simply pristine. \n\nThe kitchen has everything you need, including a very functional layout. All 3 bathrooms had great soap, shampoo and conditioner, nice towels and very spacious-- including headroom. My 6'5\" husband often has to duck in older homes, but had no issues here. \n\nI could go on and on about this lovely home, but trust that it will appeal to the very fussiest.",

We had such an incredible stay, it was everything we could have wanted and more. Mornings were so peaceful out on the front porch, and we had a great time cooking in the kitchen. The beds were so comfortable, and exploring the intricacies of the home was one of the best parts of the weekend. So many small touches made for the perfect weekend. Thank you so much Steve!",

We had such an incredible stay, it was everything we could have wanted and more. Mornings were so peaceful out on the front porch, and we had a great time cooking in the kitchen. The beds were so comfortable, and exploring the intricacies of the home was one of the best parts of the weekend. So many small touches made for the perfect weekend. Thank you so much Steve!",

We enjoyed the interesting historical art and maps that were hung throughout the house. The herb garden outside was so quaint and we made use of them in our cooking. There are beautiful flowers and lawns and huge, amazing shade trees! Our daughters enjoyed playing the grand piano. The master bathroom is quite large and nice. Stephen met us at the house to give us the key and introduce himself. He left us muffins and fresh cut flowers in the kitchen. Such a fun and unique stay, perfect for some family together time! Thank you Stephen!",

We had a great time exploring all the historical sites in the area, as well.  We highly recommend the Mod Pod Lake House and hope to stay again!",

My son calls it our “happy place”, and I agree! Already ready to book for next summer. ☮️",

Of note, this place can be accessed from the main house via a door inside the unit.",

I’ve had a last minute plan for my elopement dinner celebration (I also rented the conservatory) and it was the best decision ever! It’s beautiful inside and outside! Everything is high quality and lovely! We were amazed to hear that this beautiful mansion carries a beautiful story to match with it! You can tell that place was built and maintained with love and dedication 😍\n\nJessica (the person I interacted through the Airbnb platform) was very communicative and did a great job recommending me options of caterers - I ended up going with Simply from Scratch (loved their food and service!). She took the time to answer all my questions through the phone, and made sure to coordinate with me all the details! I was very happy to see that she cared about my event like if she was part of my family!\n\nTimothy and Tammy (the Klein Mansion Innkeepers) were the best as well! They accommodated an earlier check in so I could take my pictures at the garden before my guests’ arrival! It made a huge difference! Plus, along the day they were always coming to us to check if we needed anything else (even later in the night, 8pm -9pm, I mentioned that we were going to use the jacuzzi and Tammy offered extra towels for us to use). They were very generous and made us feel very comfortable and did an amazing job assisting us! The breakfast was just AMAZING! We left the house with big smiles and I will remember this day forever thanks to you all!!!!!\n\nIf you are wondering if the price is fair - it’s worthy every single dollar!!!! ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️",

    "summary": "Quiet house setting on Kent Island. Private, spacious bedroom suite (queen size bed) & bath with rustic pine interior throughout the house. Mini kitchen area with amenities. Close to Bay Bridge and local wedding venues.",
    "space": "This is listing 2 of 3 for this house space. This is spacious and quiet bedroom and bath for 1 or 2 people. Though I can add a twin bed in this room for a 3rd person, if needed. It features a table/desk area, Roku Smart TV, large closet, floor space for exercise, yoga mat & hand weights. Adjacent bathroom features full tub/shower, double sinks, and kitchenette with fridge, Keurig coffee maker. Coffee, tea and condiments, still and sparkling water, and breakfast snacks are provided. When you book this room individually, no one else can book the adjacent 2nd bedroom, so the area is private for you.",
    "access": "Access through the main front door with key-less entry system, through the living room on the left. Double doors lead into the suite area. This room is off to the right from there. There is a back patio area with tables and chairs that you are welcome to use.",
    "notes": "There is an iron and ironing board available upon request. You are welcome to use the microwave in the kitchen, or let me know if you have any other kitchen or laundry needs and I will accommodate you.",
    "neighborhood": "House is located on a wide open country road near the water. Great for walking, jogging or cycling. Less than 6 miles to either the Chesapeake Bay Beach Club or the Kent Manor Inn, both popular wedding venues, easy to get to without having to get on the highway. Also easy access to the Cross Island Trail for walking, jogging or cycling. There are plenty of good restaurants and shopping nearby.",
    "transit": "There is no public transportation to speak of on Kent Island. I can help you arrange local transportation if you need it. Kent Island is 30 minutes from Annapolis, an hour away from either Baltimore or Washington, DC, and 45 minutes from BWI airport. It's just about 5 miles away from the Bay Bridge Airport for you small plane pilots!",
    "interaction": "When I am there I am available to answer questions, recommend local destinations and activities, and be as much or as little company as you need.",
    "house_rules": "No smoking in the house, really. If you must smoke, you may do so on the back porch and I'll provide you with an ashtray. Quiet after 11. Be tidy and courteous.",

For an old home (1920) the amenities were very modern, from the automated greeting when I walked through the door to the lights setting the mood when I entered another room.\nTimothys muffins are really good and went very well with the morning coffee. \n\nI will absolutly recomend this location and look forward to visiting again.

Located between Shippensburg/Carlisle areas, there is so much to see and do within driving distance.  History enthusiast...you have so many places to choose from.  Maybe wine is more to your liking...it's a matter of which winery do I choose first.  Enjoy hiking...then nearby Michaux State Forest is the perfect place to go or the Cumberland Rails to Trails. Perhaps you prefer to just relax and enjoy dinner on the deck or sit around a firepit and enjoy the evening. Whatever your preference, be sure to enjoy your \"home away from home.\"",

The host were more than gracious to give myself and family members a tour of the 1800's building they worked very hard to restore. The amenities and style of the interior best that which you would experience at most hotels. The location within the local area made the stay very convenient. The studio was very well supplied and clean and served almost as ones own personal apartment away from home.",

Just walking into the house had kind of a special feeling, with all of the special garden features that were framing the front of the house - very European feeling.  The amount of space was perfect - everyone had their own bedroom AND bathroom. The kitchen had all the things needed to cook and we love to cook when we are on vacation. Even though Laurent was on vacation in a different time zone, he was very responsive to any questions we had. There were places for both the adults and the kids to enjoy their time. It didn’t feel like an Airbnb, it felt like a home.  The attention to detail that Laurent pays to many aspects of his Airbnb make it a very special place to stay.",

The large table that seated 12 was ideal for family meals and games. The wi-fi was strong and available throughout the home. Laurent was quickly responsive via email, and his neighbor/friend Steve was available on site if we needed anything.  This home is a private residence with personal art objects throughout.  We respected Laurent's request for certain personal objects that were off limits to guests.  The deck and large yard are also lovely and accessible. The yard amenities, as the trampoline and deck furniture, were much enjoyed.  \nWe definitely recommend this home for those who prefer a convenient, modern Bethesda location with a large, well-equipped kitchen, great room, private bedrooms with en suite baths, ambiance throughout the property and easy parking.",

Laurent was flexible and responsive and ensured we had everything setup for our arrival (including milk, eggs, bread and cereal for first breakfast!). The place was amazing with a great art collection and lots to do as a family. It was just 20-25 mins to DC and would highly recommend to anyone with a large party for their DC vacation.",

This dream combines many of my true passions including meeting people, travel (have been to approx. 70 countries) and my love for cooking.  I'm trying to make this B&B experience something special; something different than other B&B's bringing in a very social aspect and an open arm/welcoming environment.  If you're open to having an experience where you feel more like you're staying with great friends where you can be yourself and truly relax and enjoy life, then I hope you will please consider having your next B&B stay at Hummingbird Inn.  Me, and my faithful and super friendly Inn Dog, Tru are waiting to welcome you in our home!",

Every where you look there is something both interesting and beautiful to look at - from the paintings, prints, and carvings to the gorgeous hardwood furniture - including a 100 year old, tuned piano - to the claw foot tubs and antique lighting fixtures. The house is clean, full of light, and surrounded by an epic wraparound porch and beautiful pollinator gardens. The bed was super comfy! We live on a farm in the country and I was so inspired by the plantings I ran to the garden store as soon as I got home. Breakfast was special. Our waitress, Bev, was a fascinating person to talk to and the courses were all delicious and well prepared. Eric and Michael, were so friendly and creative and full of helpful tips. We were intrigued by the events, murder mysteries, and dark dinners they organize. The Inn is a unique destination and we loved our stay. Thank you so much",

The room is large and has lots of natural light, and the bathroom is enormous. The whole space was very clean, with lots of extra linens & towels. Zu was quick to respond when I had questions and one small issue with the entry code was resolved within fifteen minutes. One note: the room is within the house and doesn’t have an internal lock. Generally when staying in a room in someone else’s house, I prefer when there’s a lock on the door — that said, we felt very safe and didn’t have any issues. All around a lovely place!",

More than enough towels and pillows were provided, as well as bathroom essentials. Having a private bathroom makes all the difference!\n\nThere was only one small glitch in that the overhead light/fan wasn't working. Zu was very quick in responding to me about the light, although she happened to be away when I was there and so couldn't fix it. There were two lamps in the main room, which helped.\n\nThe traffic could be very noisy in the evening. It wasn't constant, but fairly frequent, with some vehicles revving down the street loud enough to drown out whatever I was watching on my laptop. But I wasn't familiar with the area and how noisy it might be before booking.",

The residential wing includes a comfortable private bedroom attached to a bathroom with sauna in a beautiful three-story house. We are located an easy 10-minute walk to downtown, F&M, and just a few steps away is Chestnut Hill Café, a popular breakfast and lunch spot. In addition to Chad and I, two kittens live in the house but are not allowed in the Airbnb space.",

    "access": "A lockbox has been installed in order to accomodate safe and remote access to the house, and guests are able to get the key anytime after check-in time. For your safety and ours, access to the kitchen is no longer allowed until further notce, but we have installed a mini fridge in the room. For longer stays, we offer plates and cutlery if requested.\n\nTo access your quarters, take the stairs immediately in front of the lobby, make a U-turn at the first landing, go up four steps, and your accommodations are through the French doors.",

To learn about Lancaster's Market (rated among the top 10 worldwide by CNN Travel), look for \"Lancaster Central Market 125\" on youtube as well. Chad, who co-hosts this Airbnb listing, worked on both videos in filming, editing, and sound production. He can also tell you pretty much everything you want to know about Lancaster.",

Uber and cab rides are readily available and, if taking short trips within the city, not expensive. They're actually a better alternative to driving downtown and looking for parking.",

Jayne is uniquely multitalented, cares deeply about the space, and keeps it sparkling. The cats are timid and sweet. The location is great. A hidden gem.",

It is located in a really safe area with safe neighborhoods, which is one of the main reasons I choose to stay here prior to my arrival to Baltimore. Self-parking is always available on the street.

We treat each place as we do our own, with love, generosity, reciprocity and living by original principals. Welcome!",
    "space": "Chateau de L’amour is an oasis in the Virginia countryside, between Washington, DC and the Blue Ridge Mountains. This home has been a space for our family to enjoy city and mountains, a place where we have hosted executive retreats, intensives, and other small events. As our kids have now left the nest and we travel extensively for our work, we are making this beautiful family home available as part of the Living Design Network of homes and retreat spaces across the U.S.",
    "access": "Guests have access to the entire home, except to the owners library.  There are also a couple of closets that are locked where we store additional items and inventory.",
    "neighborhood": "The Chateau is nestled in a cul-de-sac.  We have also created a small park to the side of the house for evening fires and relaxation in nature.",
    "transit": "There is parking available on the driveway.  We usually get 5-6 vehicles parked safely, and you can also use the street for additional parking.",
    "interaction": "Your host, Angela de la Meza, is a resident artist and has access to the house and will pop in if available and if needed.  As an artist, Angela is also available for artistic and creative experiences.  Please inquire.",

    "summary": "Our historic Farm is nestled in 700 acres of the Piedmont foothills. Your Farm Stay, in the stunning 1780s Manor home, lets you experience life on a working cattle operation. The home is decorated with period antiques, yet all modern comforts await you. Stroll the gardens, fields & forests. Fish in your private ponds. During your Private Farm Tour we'll meet the Wagyu and 4-wheel to the mountain top to enjoy the incredible views.  Private Wagyu dinner avail. Wineries all around!  Stable avail.",
    "space": "Located on 700 acres in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, our farm is steeped in Virginia history, predating the Civil War. The stunning Manor home, which was built in the late 1700's with additions added in the 1800's and renovated in 2014, has been lovingly and painstakingly preserved.  Although the Farm is the most photographed and painted farm in the County and has been featured in many articles & on garden tours, until now, the home has never offered FarmTour & Stay.   \nTo embrace its historic character, this magnificent home has been decorated with period antiques, yet includes all modern comforts. Each bedroom has its own theme and unique decor - from the Fox Room to the Blue Room.  The Master Bedroom's Turkish rugs and its adjoining master bath decorated with a wall-sized Turkish mosaic, provides a comfortable, quiet place to rejuvenate.  Take tea in the parlor and loosen up your rusty-fingers on the Steinway baby grand.  Relax or jump on the computer in the Reading Room paneled in original cherrywood harvested from the property.  Whether you're sipping a fine Virginia bourbon in the Cherry Room circa 1830, enjoying a gourmet meal on the 16-person dining table circa mid-1700's, or chilling with a movie in the modern basement theatre on comfortable, plush sofas,  you will feel comfortable and immersed  in a history few will ever have the opportunity to experience. \nOnce you're settled in, we'll take you on your Private Farm Tour to see our farm operations,  meet our friendly Wagyu cattle, and 4-wheel to the top of the mountain to talk about the farm and our husbandry practices, while enjoying the most memorable views in the area. \nAfter the tour, you're off to explore.  Right in your backyard is the stone house where George Washington passed thru while surveying nearby land in 1769. You may prefer to fish in the 6 ponds on the property that await your prize-winning catch (& release) or hike through the vast pastures & forests. For the cowfolks, join us to feed the cattle and tend to the barn animals. Come evening, enjoy the beautiful outdoor terrace with a glass of local Virginia wine while watching the sunset over the Blue Ridge mountains.  Weather & season permitting, the full-size pool, cabana, bathhouse, basketball courts, and gourmet outdoor kitchen with Italian brick oven is available for your use.\nThe home's six bedrooms and 6.5 bathrooms  accommodates several couples or a large family easily.  \nThe Farm is close to Great Meadows for the Gold Cup, restaurants and shopping in Upperville, Marshall, and Middleburg, endless hiking trails, including the Appalachian Trail, and more wineries than you could visit in a week. During your Farm Stay, we can arrange a Private Gourmet Wagyu Dinner with one of our Resident Chefs.  You may never want to leave and we'll count the days 'til your return! \nNote: In order to ensure your safety and that of our animals, only the guests on your registered Farm Stay may stay and/or enjoy the amenities on the Farm during your Farm Stay.",

    "interaction": "We will receive our guests when they arrive to show them around,  look over the rules and accessible areas, and confirm the scheduled Farm Tour.  Guests are welcome to spend time feeding with us on the morning after their arrival and will have lots of opportunities to enjoy a bunch or a little of Life on The Farm Stay.  We will be available and working on-site during your stay, so please reach out when you have any questions.",
    "house_rules": "This property is an actual farm.  There will be farm operations going on as daily operations. During your Private Farm Tour, we will ask that you complete our Agritourism waiver form, available ahead of time by email.  \nATTENTION:  Under Virginia law, there is no liability for an injury to or death of a participant in an agritourism activity conducted at this agritourism location if such injury or death results from the inherent risks of the agritourism activity.

They went above and beyond by providing local and delicious restaurant recommendations, assisting with lighting the fireplace in the room, and ensuring we had everything we needed. The room was everything we hoped for (though do note that the piano seems to be a decorative piece), and the property was beautiful and walkable. In the morning, they cooked and served us the most delicious breakfast which included coffee and fresh juice, melt in your mouth bacon, perfectly browned waffles, and the most delicate and flavorful vegetable quiche. Highly, highly(!) recommend this lovely BnB to anyone looking for a comfortable and peaceful getaway with really thoughtful hospitality.",

We had a large group and ended up using all 9 bedrooms. It was so nice that even though we had kids with naptimes, the house was big enough that we weren't bothering each other.  The kids loved exploring the many rooms and historic artifacts.  There were large rooms for us all to hang out and play games, and also small rooms if we wanted to be by ourselves and read a book.\n\nThere were a few cons despite the many pros. The carpets were a bit dirty, there was some missed trash under one of the beds, and our bathroom smelled a bit. Location-wise, it took about 45+ mins to get to Rehoboth beach, so we ended up just heading to Slaughter Beach and looking for rocks/shells. There wasn't a whole lot to do in the area, although we did hit some local restaurants.\n\nHowever, we really had a great time and would recommend!",

The land is absolutely gorgeous. Craig gave us a tour of the entire trails and woods. Between the barn, the cave/waterfall, the views, and the fishing, this place was more than beautiful. Craig was incredibly helpful and friendly the entire time. We will definitely be returning soon!",

The abundant flora and fauna did not disappoint in the various areas: woods, meadows, marshy fields, etc.. The cave and other natural features were beautiful as well. We had dinner and breakfast at Buck's diner just down the road and enjoyed the friendly staff and found the food to be much better than your typical American diner fare. The only thing I would change is to have a map of the property (even just a rough sketch) because although Craig gave us some directions, we were still a bit confused as to where his property boundaries were when riding the 4 wheeler. We weren't sure if the houses around were his rentals or someone else's property. It's just easier for me to have things on paper. Overall, was a beautiful place to visit, whether you like to hike or ride ATVs.",

The renovated barn is a really cool place to stay, exactly as the pictures represented.  The property is beautiful and peaceful.  Craig was a great host and made us feel very welcome.  He met us to check in and gave us a tour of the barn, offered to show us around the property if needed, and stopped by to see if we needed anything before we left.  We went out to a couple places in the area, but we mostly just stayed on the property relaxing, fishing, riding our 4 wheeler out to the cave, which was very interesting to see, and we all had fun playing pool in the evenings.  We enjoyed our stay and plan to go back again sometime.",

Enjoy building new things alone or with my little one and love to do honeydolist as long as it involves building, cooking, not cleaning!  We look forward to hosting people that are looking for a place to unwind and ground themselves.",

The huge garden invites to relax with a lounge, the little pool and big trees around. It is only a short drive to Solomons Island, restaurants, shopping, museums and recreation parks. Courtney and Christian were very responsive and very helpful, giving us very good recommendations for restaurants or fun things to do in the area. We visited the Calvert Cliffs State Park which is wonderful, we went to Leonardtown and had dinner at the fun market place called Shepard‘s Old Field. And we explored the PAX River Naval Air Museum, where we even got a private tour from a former engineer in testing airplanes, now working  as a volonteer. This was very interesting. Thank you for letting us stay in your house.",

The huge garden invites to relax with a lounge, the little pool and big trees around. It is only a short drive to Solomons Island, restaurants, shopping, museums and recreation parks. Courtney and Christian were very responsive and very helpful, giving us very good recommendations for restaurants or fun things to do in the area. We visited the Calvert Cliffs State Park which is wonderful, we went to Leonardtown and had dinner at the fun market place called Shepard‘s Old Field. And we explored the PAX River Naval Air Museum, where we even got a private tour from a former engineer in testing airplanes, now working  as a volonteer. This was very interesting. Thank you for letting us stay in your house.",

Courtney and Christian were super accommodating - they came to fix the pool when it the chlorine ran out, cleaned up their grill for us, and were were very generous in letting us use food in the pantry (since it's their home, they have a fully stocked pantry, so made cooking much easier than a typical airbnb, because they you could use a little bit of olive oil, or sugar, or spices, etc. - They also have excellent kitchenware!)",

    "summary": "Spacious waterfront home with three bedrooms and a seasonal above ground swimming pool/fire pit.   The home is bright and airy and thoughtfully decorated to make your perfect getaway along the Maryland shore.  Enjoy kayaking or crabbing off the pier while watching beautiful sunsets.",
    "space": "This house has been our primary home for the last 6 years, so you will find some of our personal items, but we have cleared closet and drawer space for you.  We love this area because of the beautiful views and all of the fun places to visit close by.  What makes it even better, is being able to share it with you.  \nThe home is in a neighborhood with 2 marinas.  The house backs to Town Creek, which leads directly to the Patuxent River.  The water in the creek is deep and calm, so it's perfect for kayaking or floating!  Thr marina next door has some old boats that are mostly underwater, so you can catch crabs super easy with a net near them. We are just over the bridge from Solomons island, which has a gorgeous boardwalk and tons of nice restaurants to enjoy.  Solomons Island is where the July 4th fireworks are set off.  To view the fireworks, you can drive over the bridge to the island and enjoy the show!  \nThe home was originally a beach bungalow with 1 bedroom built in 1929.  In 1963 the home was converted to a 2 story home, a breezeway added, and a garage.  In 2018 the home was renovated again with new flooring, a custom kitchen with quartzite counters, 2 marble bathrooms, and new windows\n  The home has lots of character that i hope you enjoy while you visit!  Because it is 100 years old, and we tried to keep as much character as possible, you will see some original character of the home fr 1929.  So please, understand this is an old home that has some quirkiness about it that anyone who loves old homes should appreciate. \n You will be close to lots of shopping locally, with being about 5 minutes from major stores and strip malls.  For activities, you can always enjoy hanging out watching TV in the house, go kayaking, swimming, fishing, or enjoy lots of local entertainment.  Again, we are super close to Solomons Island, which is gorgeous and also has a fun marine museum with a lighthouse you can visit.  We are about 20 minutes from Leonardtown, MD which has lots of small town character, a downtown wharf, and a fun market place called Shepard's Old Field where you can shop for boutique clothing or have a craft beer at the Beer Garden.  Leonardtown also has a fun waterfront restaurant called Fritzie's Marina that has great food and atmosphere.  We also enjoy Stoney's Clarks Landing restaurant that is a short ride from the house.  It has peaceful water views from the beach out back.  If you enjoy crabs, we have 2 traps off the pier, or you can tie chicken necks from a string to catch them.  We are conveniently located near several beaches including Myrtle Point and Calvert Cliffs.\nThe front door is equipped with a coded lock, so you won't have to worry about lost keys.",
    "access": "The whole house, yard, pier, and pool are available to you.  We don't allow access to the garage or the apartment above the garage, as our personal items are stored there.  The garage apartment has its own entrance and parking spot, and occupied by a full time tenant.",
    "notes": "The garage and apartment over the garage are not available to the guests.  This is used for storage and the apartment is occupied by a tenant.  The apartment has a separate entrance and parking spot.\n\nThis is our main house we live in.  We rent it out while we vacation, so you will find some personal items in the home.  I have cleared a section of my closet, 2 drawers in the chest, and 1 drawer per nightstand for you in the main bedroom.   Please respect our items while you stay.\n\nThe refrigerator has been cleaned out, and only a few items will be in it.  We do have lots of condiments, eggs, frozen items, and pantry items for you to enjoy.  Please feel free to eat or drink anything in the house!",
    "neighborhood": "The house is located in a small community that has 2 marinas.  The neighborhood is actuall an island that is connected by a land bridge near the fishing pier.  The Marina next door used to be a resort that many presidents, including John F. Kennedy, have vacationed at.",
    "transit": "The neighborhood is beautiful to take a walk.  It is a small island with a land bridge connecting the island to the rest of the neighborhood.  There are no stores within walking distance, but there is a marina and dive shop next door.",
    "interaction": "We offer a safe self check in, but are easily available by phone at any time.",
    "house_rules": "We have a full-time tenant in the apartment over the garage. Their is a separate entrance for the apartment. \n\nWe have an owners closet with a lock to keep our belongings in.\n\nThe drawers in the bedrooms have an Airbnb sticker designated for your use.",

Don't take our word for it; take a look at our reviews and see what our previous guests are saying about us!\n\nHow did we end up in the Airbnb hospitality business? Our founders were \"road warriors\" for >10 years of our lives, in the consulting industry, the music industry, traveling nursing, and more.  We stayed in a ton of different places, and learned what we loved (and what we hated!) at all of the places we've stayed over the years. We appreciated seamless check ins and check outs, friendly, unobtrusive hosts, sparking clean spaces, abundant amenities, and rapid help if we needed it. We reflect these qualities, and more, in all of our HostWise properties throughout the country. From myself and my team, we can't wait to host you at our place! \n\nRemember - life is too short to stay home!",

I'm born & raised here, but I spent much of my career prior to this on the road. \nI'm the Ground Operations Manager for Pittsburgh.  Prior to HostWise, I worked in the Event and Show Production industry. Wearing every hat from Tour Manager, Sound Engineer, to Event Manager, I got used to the 24/7 grind of traveling across the country. I realized that I could create a better guest experience, so entered the world of short term rentals. I takes pride in managing a hard working crew, meticulous turnovers, and providing our guests a memorable, flawless stay!\nWhen I'm not working, I love to travel, I'm a dessert junkie (ask me about my favorite places in town!) a gamer, and a musician!",

People other than those in the Guest party may not stay overnight in the property without prior notice. Any other person in the property is the sole responsibility of Guest. The host has not represented this unit as an event facility, therefore, there is a limit to the number of any visitors at any one time (in addition to registered occupants) of four (4) up to a maximum of eight (8) persons in the property at any given time. At no time may any of these visitors remain overnight or assume any guest privileges whatsoever.\n\n3.

There is no daily housekeeping service. While the property has been thoroughly cleaned prior to your arrival and linens and bath towels are included, daily maid service is not included in the rate.\n\n5. We are very flexible hosts, and do not ask or expect our guests to \"clean\" prior to check out, other than starting the dishwasher. However, we don't expect our guests to leave a mess; cleaning that requires substantially more time than usual due to garbage, stains, spills, etc., will be charged to the Guest at $35 per hour.\n\n6. Late check-outs are not permitted without prior discussion, as our cleaning teams are punctual. Late check outs require additional cleaners to be brought in, and will be charged at $50 in half hour increments.",

We all had privacy when desired, but also enjoyed being together in the numerous gathering spaces. The kitchen was everything we hoped for with a large island, high end appliances and beautiful cabinets.\nThe library/office space was also exceptional & my husband enjoyed working from there.\nI highly recommend this home for a large group.

We love the ability to enjoy solitude on the farm and make day trips for more excitement. Our parents recently passed away and we think their home on the farm is an excellent place for guests to relax and recharge.   Come enjoy the quiet life, surrounded by nature's beauty and be well.

We brought outdoor games but didn’t really use them because of the flies and mosquitoes, but most of the house has windows which allowed you to see the river.\n\nWe split our time between Chincoteague and Ocean City, which is why we chose this location.  We also went into Berlin a couple of times.  Snow Hill was tiny but charming, a beautiful spot on the Eastern Shore.\n\nThe house was large and comfortable; we brought everything we needed to cook and make picnic lunches, but did use some of the kitchen gadgets.  The kitchen was fully stocked with silverware, plates, pans, etc.  The bathrooms also were large and stocked with toiletries.  Overall, it was a nice house in a beautiful setting!  We forgot to sign the guest book, just one of the reasons we would love to come back!",

This area was historically called Red Landing and an old ramp and concrete kiln that might have provided pitch to repair the bottom of boats trafficking the river remain on the property as evidence of a bygone era when steamboats regularly traveled the river .  \n\n For those looking for peace and quiet, communing with nature, this stand alone house offers a chance to stay in the midst of one of the most visited areas on the east coast.  Where else on the east coast can you spend time in a place without any other views of neighbors?  The Cottage sits on a point of land that affords views of the river and the adjoining state forest.  The privacy is spectacular; especially since a major resort that expands to 300,000 people in the summer is only minutes away.",

The house is so much better than we expected and we were very happy with our choice. It is spacious, very comfortable, and extra clean, and the owners were very responsive.  The grounds are beautiful and peaceful. After a hike up Old Rag mountain, which  is only a 20 min drive away from the house,  we dipped in the local swimming hole which is minutes away.  If u like to cook, like me, the kitchen is well stocked with utensils, gadgets, and good pans.   We are planning another stay in the future to hike the white oak canyon trail next.  (In fact, I am reluctant to post this review, fearing it will become too popular.)",

    "summary": "Charming, sun-filled East Liberty/Friendship home with piano and private yard",
    "space": "Please note:  If you are looking for a luxury hotel-like stay then this is not the place for you.  However, if staying in a 100+ year old Victorian-era building with plenty of architectural charm and floors that tend to creak sounds like a good idea then this might be a good fit.  \n\nEach room has high ceilings and has plenty of natural light.  The apartment is my home and I've furnished it sparingly.  Highlights include a 1928 baby grand piano, two acoustic guitars, and a Gaggia espresso machine, all of which you are welcome to play.",
    "access": "You'll have the entire apartment to yourself along with the backyard.",
    "notes": "There is no cable TV but Amazon Fire Stick is available for you to use in the bedroom.\n\nThere is no A/C but ceiling fans are in the bedroom and kitchen.  \n \nThe floors are original, are uneven in some places, and creak.\n\nThe dishwasher is currently out of service. \n\nThere is a tenant upstairs but no shared walls with any other apartment.  \n\nWasher and dryer are coin-operated and are located in the lobby.\n\nI live in the apartment so the refrigerator and freezer will not be empty.\n\nThe backyard is available for use on an \"as-is\" basis.  I cut the lawn whenever I'm in town so it might be overgrown during your stay depending on my travel schedule.",
    "neighborhood": "Friendship is a beautiful residential neighborhood within walking distance to so many amenities that a car is not needed.  Walk to the restaurants and shops of East Liberty, Shadyside, Bloomfield, or Garfield.  Whole Foods, Giant Eagle Market District, and ALDI grocery stores are all less than 10 minutes walk away.   \n\nWalkscore of 93.",
    "transit": "Getting to and from Downtown is a breeze thanks to the East Busway stop at Negley which is less than a 10 minute walk away.",
    "interaction": "I'm generally available for any questions via email.  Responses may be delayed if I am out of the country or out of service area.",
    "house_rules": "No shoes in the house.  \n\nQuiet hours after 10pm to be respectful to the upstairs neighbor.  \n\nPlease leave the apartment as you found it, including washing any dishes you may have used.  \nWith the exception of tea and coffee please do not consume any food or drink that does not belong to you. If you are storing food in the refrigerator please discard any open containers upon checking  out. (Please see above rule regarding leaving the apartment as you found it—this is my home and not a hotel or 100% rental!)\nUpon checking out, please strip bed and place used sheets and towels in the hamper below the bathroom sink.  \n\nRecycling trash can is to the right of the refrigerator.  This can has clear bags meant for recycling.  \n\nAdditional trash bags are located under the sink.  \n\nFull trash bags may be placed in the rear of the property next to the garage adjacent to the alley (Ravoux Way).\n\nPlease do not adjust the thermostat as it controls the heat for the apartments upstairs as well.\n\nNo drinks on the piano, please!\n\nPets are accepted on a case-by-case basis. Please message me if you are traveling with pets.\n\nNo illegal file-sharing/Bittorrent usage is permitted.  You are liable for any damages due to copyright infringement during your stay.",

Bike/walk to the beach and walk one block into historic Lewes with its amazing atmosphere - beachy, safe, clean, romantic, great for foodies.",
    "space": "Our family has long enjoyed all that historic downtown Lewes and its beaches has to offer.  We have lived here in town for many years and three years ago bought our dream home.  It took our breath away to be able to purchase and renovate this home.  It was like an HGTV moment when we were given a sledge hammer to open the wall to see if the old fireplace was there behind it (it was)!  During our renovation, Craftsman Tools even came and filmed a commercial here!  We are now excited to share our home.  \n\nWe have traced the history of our home back to 1849 but have been told it goes back much further.  Rumor has it, our home was called the “Stage Coach Inn” back in the day;  you will see the historical carriage house when you pull in the driveway that had stables in it until recent years.  We were told by the previous owners that is where the horses were fed, overnighted, etc. with the carriage pulled right into the driveway area.  We have a historical carriage house on our property for you to store your water toys and the driveway is large enough to bring your boat and park. \n\nIn addition to location, here are some things we are pleased to offer:\n\n•\tSleeping for 8 in 5 bedrooms with 4 bathrooms \n•\tA kitchen upstairs and another downstairs which is great for multiple families, a break from one another if needed and or just some quiet time to enjoy early coffee before everyone else is up - general pantry items/spices available.\n•\tKeurig coffee pots in both kitchens\n•\tWasher and dryer\n•\tParking for 4 in the driveway, on-street parking for compact out front and additional public parking across the street\n•\tThe first floor of our carriage house is available for you to store your kayaks, bikes, beach stuff \n•\tThere are two bikes for your use; some games in case of a rainy day\n•\tVarious beach chairs/toys are available to you (please wash them off with the outside hose when you are done with them)\n•\tVarious balls for the courts/fields across the street will be on hand\n•\tTwo different work stations (5G) for any who have to take a zoom call or work a day while here\n•\tAn amazing outdoor shower that brings nature right to you\n•\tWe put up a clothes line because we like to dry our beach towels and bathing suits in the sun after our beach day\n•\tWe are leaving our baby grand piano to enjoy for any who play the piano \n•\tA Weber gas grill is available \n•\tWe live locally so quick support is available for questions/concerns\n\nWe do ask that you:\n\n•\tNot smoke in our home\n•\tNot sneak pets in \n•\tHelp keep sand out – two levels of our home are hardwood floors\n•\tLeave shoes outside whenever possible – when we stay here we go shoeless \n•\tNo wet bathing suits on the furniture\n•\tNo parties – we love our neighbors and hope they love us back (and continue to)\n•\tKeep the house/carriage house locked when you are gone\n\nWe love our home and enjoy time in it also.  Thank you for treating it kindly while you are here. \n\nWe look forward to welcoming you!\n\nPlease don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions.",
    "access": "The entire home will be yours during your stay.",
    "notes": "Perfectly situated on the Canal Front Park and the Lewes/Rehoboth canal!  Pleasure boats, fishing boats, water taxis, and the Overfalls Lightship will excite your nautical desires and can be seen from any room on the front of the house and of course, from the Adirondack chairs on the front porch!  Grab coffee and watch them start their early mornings, or a glass of wine and watch them return from their day at sea.  And, if your timing is right you will be able to watch the ospreys in their nest high above the water's edge, often flying about for food.  \n\nWalk inland from our home one block to the quaint shops, many excellent dining options, our local Lewes bakery/coffee shop, toy store, ice cream parlor and Historical Society. Lewes has an amazing atmosphere, it's sunny, beachy, safe, clean, romantic, great for foodies and has a little something for everyone. \n\nFrom our home you will have amazing fun in the sun and when the sun goes down you can walk to everything!!! We feel sure you will enjoy our location, location, location! \n\nAs for our beaches, you have many options.  Closest is Lewes Beach (3/4 mile) - sidewalks allow for you to walk it easily or even bike it.  Lewes Beach is on the Delaware Bay so more calm than the ocean which you can enjoy at the Cape Henlopen State Park.  Lewes Beach is perfect for families with younger/older ones who worry about getting knocked over with waves.  Cape Henlopen State Park is approximately 3 miles from our home, its beautiful beaches with fun waves to jump and awesome bike trails you can even take to the Rehoboth boardwalk. You can pick your beach preference or try them both during your stay.  \n\nWe are also directly down the street from a public boat ramp that leads right out to the Delaware Bay and Atlantic Ocean.",
    "neighborhood": "We feel that Lewes is a quiet a gem along the Delaware Beaches where families can truly get away from it all for some rest and relaxation, coupled with wonderful time together creating memories.  Lewes Beach is wonderful for youngsters and older ones amongst us as the bay allows for some to enter the water that might be fearful of the waves at other beaches.  Our downtown is very charming with parks, shopping, museums and the ability to walk to many restaurants after you enjoy your beach time.  Canal Front Park across the street has events throughout the summer.  We hope you take time to stroll along the water and watch the boats come and go – some you can see from our home in the mornings as they set out for the day.  The Historical Society behind us often has festivals such as the Annual Sea Glass Festival.  Whatever strikes your fancy while you visit Lewes, we hope you enjoy your time together as a family.",

The Canal Front park offers outdoor movies, bands, festivals, a playground, baseball fields, tennis/pickleball courts, a basketball court and other activities free to the public. Our home is one street over from quaint shops, many excellent dining options, our local Lewes bakery/coffee shop, toy store, ice cream parlor and Historical Society.

    "space": "- Eclectic and ambient, this artist home was originally conceptualized for creative brainstorming and contemplation, as well as to hold music rehearsals. \n- The property comfortably accommodates 2 guests ( & can cozily squeeze additional 2 guests in the \"Daydreamers Nook\" / Living Room 2)\n- This traditional Pittsburgh row-house was built during the industrial era, and it's interior and amenities reflect the retro vibe.\n- There is no TV on the premise and THERE IS an overhead projector (in the main Bedroom) that easily connects to a laptop (with cables provided). \n- I do live in this home and open it to guests during my travels -- You can expect to have more of an organic experience here, rather than a traditional hotel stay!",

It's a neighborhood on the rise with affordable properties, first-rate, one-of-a-kind shops and an awesome dining scene. The neighborhood has undergone such a revival that it's called a \"go-to\" destination by The New York Times. Located less than three miles from Downtown, it's a neighborhood with deep roots too. In fact, composer Stephen Foster's father charted the street plans in 1814.\n\nThe Vibe\nWalkable and welcoming. Entrepreneurial. Unique and distinct. Old-world charm, modern-day edge.\n\nThe List\nGo on an Allegheny Cemetery tour with the Office of Public Art\nTake a spin at Arsenal Bowl, where cool meets retro\nSee and be seen at Art All Night\nVisit the Great One's legacy at The Clemente Museum\nShop and eat at the Annual Joy of Cookies Cookie Tour\n\nThe Name\nNamed for Captain James Lawrence, hero of War of 1812 and famous for his dying words, \"Don't Give Up The Ship!\"\n\nOne More Thing\nStephen Foster was born here. Every July, this composer of America's first pop songs like \"Oh, Susanna\" and \"Camptown Races,\" is honored at \"Doo Dah Days,\" a music festival held at the historic Allegheny Cemetery, where Foster is buried alongside other Pittsburgh celebrities.",

The location is so isolated and quiet except a dove (we think) made a lot of noises.  Also, the window was open the first night and there were a lot of bugs flying around.  Luckily, there was a bug vacuum to use to take care of them.  The second night was better since we did not open any windows.  We enjoyed our time in the farm and will rent it again.",

    "summary": "A beautiful old farm in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains.  The 1880 farmhouse sits on a small stream that runs through the entire fifty-five acre property. The house is  clean, minimally decorated, with pasture views out of every window.\n\nThe farm is located 80 miles from Washington DC and just down the road from Sperryville, Old Rag Mountain, Skyline Drive and other local attractions.\n\n(Please contact me if you would prefer a one-night booking. I can usually accommodate you.)",
    "space": "A beautiful old farmhouse nestled in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains on a small stream called Walnut Run.\n\nThe house is clean, spacious and comfortable.\n\nThe property is fifty-five acres of secluded rolling hills that are open for guests to explore.\n\nWalnut Run Farm is a one-man operation. I am doing my best to hold on to this truly unique and beautiful property. There are financial pressures to sell and or subdivide but what makes the farm special is that it is intact and retains its sanctuary-like privacy. \n\nThe farm is perfectly sited along a little stream (Walnut Run) and sits in a bowl surrounded on one half by trees and views off to the pastures in other directions. There are the original outbuildings, including a spring house with pump, a smokehouse, a corn crib and a Virginia-styled barn.\n\nWork needs to be done everywhere around the farm. Everywhere! Each stay helps so much in preserving this truly special old farmhouse and property. \n\nThank you -\n\nJohn",

    "notes": "Dogs are allowed. There is a $35 fee for each dog. Dogs must be perfectly house trained and are NOT allowed on the beds or furniture. Guests are responsible for any and all damages.\n\nCats are allowed only if we discuss it beforehand and I am fully assured that there will not be an issue. Unfortunately, I have had problems every single time I have allowed cats. Don't get me wrong, I am an animal lover and like cats but I must protect the property.\n\n Please notify me in advance if you are bringing a pet. Thanks.",
    "neighborhood": "The farm is very close to Thornton Gap, an entrance to Shenandoah National Park and Skyline Drive. \n\nFrom the farm there is quick access to many of the noted hiking trails in the park, most notably Old Rag Mountain and White Oak Canyon.\n\nContinuing on past the entrance to Shenandoah National Park is the city of Luray, known for Luray Caverns, a national landmark. A bit further on is the Shenandoah River where there are river outfitters for rafting and canoeing.",
    "interaction": "When you arrive at the house I will have a sheet in the bedroom that provides all the information you will need to know during your stay. \n\nI will leave a couple contact numbers for me and also my email address. Email is probably the most efficient way of getting a hold of me as I check it often.",

She was available and responsive when we needed her, but respectful of our privacy when we wanted time alone.  She is very dog-friendly and our pup took to her right away, which made our stay all the better.  The neighborhood is quiet and an easy place to get in a quick dog walk.",

    "interaction": "I am available via email, text, or calling with any questions or concerns.\nWhile I enjoy interacting with guests, I also appreciate the need for privacy.\nSometimes I have activities that keep me busy so guests are not bothered much at all.\nSometimes we can get to know each other when there's opportunity.     \nI have enjoyed meals with guests, shared ideas, even had a few music jams!    Music is usually playing, sometimes  live....feel free to play the piano.  \nI do make it quiet for guests, though.",
    "house_rules": "Try to not track in mud, please.   I always remove my shoes on arrival; would appreciate guests doing the same.\nJust put dishes in the sink, please.  Eat and drink in the kitchen only.",

A room without a tv is perfect for me and the shared bathroom worked out fine. There was a bit of traffic noise, but for the most part it was really quiet. Being surrounded by so many old trees felt like a nature retreat, even so close to the city. This is a one of a kind place that I hope to return to frequently in the future.",

        "comments": "I am a student and was rotating at GBMC for 5 weeks, I stayed in Welcome hOMe 3. There was enough space for all of my clothes and personal belongings. There is a lounging chair on the side of the room that is not pictured. The room is nice, sunny, and very nice.  The bathroom is shared between 2 other guests (if the rooms are occupied) but I never had an issue. Jayne cleans it regularly and before a new guest so it was always very clean.  The kitchen can feel crowded if everyone is preparing food at the same time. The fridge is shared between everyone and can get crowded so I ended up going to the Giant (less than a 5 min drive) every other day or so to get food instead of doing weekly shopping trips. There is more than enough parking spots, so that is not an issue. It's very close to GBMC (about 10 min drive) and Towson University's library (10-15 min) which is open to students from all universities.  The neighborhood is nice and I felt safe running outside.   There is a washer and dryer in the basement. The basement is the only place in the house where you can smell that cats live there (litter box is in basement).  Other than that, it is very clean everywhere.  The cats are very cute and although I have been allergic to cats in the past, I kept them out of my room and had no problems. Jayne's boyfriend, Dallas, is friendly and made me feel comfortable while sometimes I felt like I was in the way with Jayne. I worked 12 hour shifts 3-4 times a week so on my days off, I often felt like I was in the way and not welcome to study at the table (there is no desk in room 3). There is a nice screened in porch area that was nice to eat in and a nice patio, as well.  Overall, it was a good stay but for longer trips/students/weird work hours, I would recommend one of the bigger rooms.",

Everything was just like shown in the photos. The hosts communicated well and allowed us to enjoy a late checkout. The furnishings are a bit dated and sparse, and the linens too. We'd stay here again. Thanks",

The kitchen has pretty much everything you need (my husband brought his trusty carrot peeler just in case). Check with Adam if you need something specific. \n Some of the bedrooms could use a little more furniture. But all in all it was fine. \n We will definitely try and book here again!",
