And the shower was amazing with the multiple shower heads. Also the pool and grounds in general were so nice and stylish. It was really nice relaxing by the pool after a busy day exploring. And the location was perfect for us. Right in Travis heights (super cute neighborhood) right next to So Co with a bunch of cute shops and restaurants you could walk to. If your looking for something outside of the hustle and bustle of the city, but still super close- this is it.",

On our second visit, we found all the features we had liked the first time, plus the dishwasher seemed new.  We also appreciated the ample supply of towels, kitchen ware, and delicious coffee.  As before, it was extremely clean. This time, we missed the monsoons, and were able to swim most evenings in a very pleasant and large pool. I loved looking up at the night sky and the bistro lights lighting up the pool and patio. The location, in a nice neighborhood,  was perfect for appointments in Scottsdale and for dining out.",

She was extremely communicative and always responded to questions effectively and quickly. The house and surroundings were absolutely gorgeous and also very secluded and peaceful. \n\nThe only challenge we experienced was ordering Ubers for transportation. The house location/directions are not correct within the Uber map system which caused confusion and delays. Kimberly is not at fault for this, but more a heads up for guests looking to get around.\n\nOverall, we had an amazing stay!",

Unfortunately, some of the amenities weren’t up to what we paid for (sheets had stains/hair, one toilet wasn’t working, no body wash in some bathrooms, not enough toilet paper for the weekend). I accidentally didn’t schedule the right amount of people in the app when booking so we owed her more money and while we were working on that with air BnB she would show up at the house unannounced which made us feel uncomfortable.",

Last stay was shortly after Covid & there were still a lot of restrictions in place, but this time we really got to enjoy the surroundings more.  The pool alone is SO nice to relax in & feel like you are away from everything b/c the neighborhood is a beautiful tucked away quiet oasis, but right outside the gate is all the shopping, attractions & conveniences you could possibly want at your fingertips.  Thank you again for another relaxing getaway in your wonderful guest home!",

It was ridiculously hot, so having the pool to cool off in was key. Some welcome treats from Estrella Bakery and pre-ground coffee from Presta were great touches (both are well known Tucson spots). The only bummer I had (which wasn't the hosts fault) was that I had some clothes get snacked on by moths when I hung them in the closet. No issues with the dresser or anywhere else! I had a great stay and would stay again! Just would put my clothes elsewhere in the spacious apt :)",

    "summary": "Step inside the adobe casita, where cool terra cotta tiles and Southwestern decor create a welcoming and authentic atmosphere. During the hot months, get refreshed with a dip into a turquoise pool. In the cooler months, enjoy the very best of Tucson, and come back to the modern desert outdoor spaces to relax- catch rays under a deep blue Arizona sun or find a hammock in the shade. The Casita offers you a thoughtfully designed but laid back space convenient for exploring Tucson, with vintage southwest and mid century style. *Newly improved high speed WiFi 11/1/2021\n\nOur casita is a stand alone guest house that has it's own parking and entrance and enjoys total privacy from the 1930's Spanish Colonial house and pool house on the property. The modern take on South West decor is right at home in this sweet historic property, embracing our desert city's personality. A full kitchen with fridge, oven, gas range, has all you need to cook, and the bathroom is fully stocked with bath towels, soaps, and hairdryer.  There is a comfortable queen sized bed and sitting chair in each bedroom. The simple living area has a small sofa, armchair, and a table and chairs for eating. For your use there is WiFi and TV with access to streaming services.\n\nGuests have exclusive use of the casita and the casita’s walled desert landscapes yard with table, seating, and fire pit. Guests are also welcome to enjoy the pool, grill, and other outdoor spaces that are shared with the main house and pool house on the property. The pool is not heated, and so is best enjoyed late April - October. Guests are free to use the pool at any time of year, but when the night time temperatures are still cool, expect that the water will also be cool accordingly!\n\nMy family and I live in the main house on the property, and so are easily accessible by text or in person for any needs or to give tips on enjoying Tucson. Outside of being available and helpful, we will try to stay out of your way and the homes do not overlook one another. In the shared pool, laundry, and central courtyard on the property, you may cross paths with my family or the guests staying in the pool house (when occupied). I provide treats and good local coffee for your enjoyment. I will try to accommodate your needs and can provide things such as a twin mattress or small kitchen appliances.  If you need something you don't see- don't hesitate to ask!\n\nThe casita shares the property with the host family's home, and a pool house also available on Air BNB.  Casita guests have their own private yard and seating area, but also can enjoy the shared spaces on the property- A beautiful pool and courtyard. The casita is on a quiet street in Jefferson Park, a classic midtown neighborhood on the National Historic Register. Walk to the streetcar at the close-by University hospital that takes you through the University District, 4th Ave, and downtown.\n\nA car is best for exploring all parts of the city and surrounding areas- a trip up Mount Lemmon or through Gates Pass should not be missed! Tucson is fairly sprawling and parking is not a problem. The street car is accessible by foot (taking you through the uUniversity District, 4th Ave, downtown, the Convention Center and on to the Mercado). If you bring your bike, the neighborhood runs into the Mountain Ave bike path, a good central point to access Tucson by bike. There is a bus stop for Suntran around the corner on Campbell Ave.\n\nBecause of our proximity to the hospital, there are occasional sirens/helicopter landings that can be heard in the distance from outside or if windows are open.\n\nThe pool is not heated, and so is best enjoyed late April - October. Guests are free to use the pool at any time of year, but when the night time temperatures are still cool, expect that the water will also be cool accordingly!\n\nWe also have another listing for our pool house.",

Expect privacy, but realize there are shared space on the property- if you choose to use the pool, you may see our family or pool house guests (we will communicate regarding pool use to avoid disruption).

The home was less than a 10 minute drive from the Conference Center - right off the main road. The house had plenty of beds and rooms to accommodate our group of 8 adults and 7 children. Amenities like pool, extra large fridge/freezer, two dishwashers, washer/dryer kept everyone comfortable. With many guests showering, we never ran out of hot water. The house has 3 full bathrooms with 3 showers and is stocked with everything you need from pool floaties, to margarita glasses to Bluetooth speakers, coffee, swim towels and snacks. Beyond the pool which was enjoyed by all, the kids and dad’s enjoyed catching fish out of the creek that runs behind the house. We would highly recommend staying here if you are looking for something in the area!",

We were will taken care of by Shanna with her kind and helpful updates and responses to our questions. \nWe enjoyed the backyard and the river.\nPictures in the back yard were beautiful. \nThe neighborhood is peaceful \nThe rooms are nice and they come equipped with just what you need but no clutter. Nice welcoming decor. \nThe fridge was huge and we had plenty cooking to do which was easy in this kitchen. \n\nSmall kids need constant supervision because there is an open pool and river out back but the main door has a latch to keep them from opening on their own. The bedroom door did not have a latch and it goes straight to the pool also. Just remember small kids need more attention at this place but we had small kids and did fine with our supervision.\n\nThe upstairs loft is so cozy and spacious \nThe master bedroom is nice and spacious for multiple sleeping guests \nWe will absolutely look this place up again for our next visit! Thank you!",

The welcome package of fruit, water coffees and goodies was appreciated. The bed was comfy and although it did not have a full size blanket, we seemed to manage with just sheets and I am sure if requested it would have been provided. We had a couple glitches that were resolved quickly. Maria was very helpful, although we initially had a language barrier issue, technology helped with that.

He had a couple hiccups in the first few days related to hot water & getting the AC working but Matt was super responsive in getting someone to resolve these issues. However, the apartment was very well-suited for both of us to live & work. We were able to cook lots of meals at home in the kitchen. We also enjoyed the Dolce Gusto espresso machine and sitting on our private balcony sipping our espressos each morning. I also want to say we were especially appreciative of the wonderful housekeeping & water delivery from Maria! She's a true gem and really made our stay feel special!! Finally, the location is great because you're located so close to lots of great restaurants & cafes between Constituyentes & CTM. We really love this area. Thanks Matt!!",

The safe is big enough to fit a couple of laptops and a bunch of other stuff which we appreciated for extra peace of mind. The area is safe in any case.\n\nThe location is good, walking distance to the touristy area but far enough to be quiet. It doesn't have an upscale feel yet but it looks like new luxury apartments are coming up in the are all the time. The parking spot was a big plus. We enjoyed getting coffee at Quadra Cafe nearby, and food at COA and El Fogon.",

We wanted to offer visitors of Scottsdale a high end, affordable vacation rental that is walking distance to all the greatest places in Old Town. So, we purchased a property, completely renovated it with the highest end finishes and hired a decorator to furnish it to the 9's.  \r\n\r\nWe have lived in Scottsdale for 5 years so if you need any restaurant recommendations, sporting tickets, golf info, activities - anything you can think of we have probably done it and can help point you in the right direction.  We want you to have a great vacation in our property, we live 2 miles away and can accommodate almost anything you can dream of. \r\n\r\nMark is a licensed Realtor in Arizona and a professional Air B&B host.   You have nothing to worry about, relax and enjoy your stay in our property. ",

We truly believe its a chance to see the city you are visiting like a local, and we make sure to help with that. \n\nDallas has been our home for over a decade and we think it has so much to offer. We are always willing to help find a cool place to eat or a fun local bar. \n\nHosting guests started out as a side hobby but has turned into a full-time gig, and we wouldn't have it any other way. We are passionate about making sure you have a seamless comfortable stay and if it's your first time booking on Airbnb we aim to make you an Airbnb booker for life. We have hosted celebrities, workgroups, families, weddings, and everything in-between. \n\nWe are excited to host you and your group, please reach out with any questions at all! ",

The housekeeping staff did a great job of cleaning and everything was spic and span.  There are lots of eateries within a reasonable driving distance.\nKeith communicated all throughout the process and was very responsive with our queries.  Unlike other AirBnbs where rules are galore with fines for every small actions Keiths place had basic common sense rules that every guest should know and adhere to. The pool was an added bonus to cool off in the Texas heat. Will definitely stay here again if the opportunity presents itself.",

When someone booked the place for the day before us, we thought we had lost the  the ability to check-in early, which was going to be a problem for my unique circumstances -- until Keith  rearranged his cleaning crew to accommodate my needs!   Wow!  I can't thank you enough!  Soon after check-in, Keith brought over MORE pool toys for my grandson. Keith was a great communicator every step of the way. It was obvious he wanted our stay to be awesome - and it was. I also appreciated how Keith cares about his neighbors and makes sure his guests are never a nuisance.  I will gladly stay in any of Keith's properties in the future.",

Some favorite places that we have traveled to are; The Maldives, South Africa, the Far East and anyplace off the beat and path! We have a good feel for what makes people comfortable when they are traveling and have incorporated these things into our condo. We've been in Phoenix for 33 years now and love Arizona. I am a metalsmith, love gardening, decorating, the outdoors and rescue animals. I am originally from Vancouver, BC and my husband is originally from New York City. ",

We had high hopes but the reality was even better. The pool towels, the hair dryer, the full array of kitchen implements, two televisions and etc. and etc. All the amazing little details added to the total experience. This was 10 times better than the commercial hotel chain we stayed with last year. Thank you!\n\nVeronica from California - \n“Just perfect. I loved everything about this place. It’s stylish, extremely clean, safe, quiet and comfortable. Everything was easy, and extras like snacks, charging station, toiletries, pillows, much appreciated...This host obviously used her own experiences from traveling to create such a thoughtful and welcoming space. There’s a legit fully equipped kitchen, and it’s THE best location in Scottsdale. I walked alone to bars, restaurants, grocery, circle K, and never waited longer than 3 minutes for an uber. The grounds were lovely, and my fellow over-packers will be thrilled to have a parking space 5 feet from the back door.

    "summary": "Embrace the luxury of this tastefully appointed condo. The residence features unique artwork, cheerful colors, contrasting motifs, wood finishes, and access to shared amenities including hot tubs, a BBQ patio, and a pool, all on the rooftop.\n\nLunada is located in the heart of Playa del Carmen, close to all the best activities and amenities of Playa and 1/2 way between Cancun and Tulum.  \n\nOnce you arrive at Lunada you will be impressed as soon as you walk in the door.  Walk into the fully equipped kitchen with adjacent dining area and drink bar and start to unwind.  As you open the double patio doors the hammock looks inviting while you look at the peaceful courtyard.  Watch a movie on the 55\" smart flat screen TV or enjoy your music via blutooth on the stereo while you relax on the comfortable couch with a refreshing beverage.  \n\nDown the hall you will find two relaxing bedrooms both with their own full tile bathroom and rain shower heads in both showers to start your day right.  The master bedroom has a king size bed and a 48\" smart flatscreen tv.  The second bedroom has 2 double beds and a walk in closet complete with a safe for your valuables and electronics.\n\nWhen its time to cool down, head up to the rooftop.  This is in one of the best rooftops around with a pool, lots of loungers, 2 hot tubs a and a BBQ grill.  There are plenty of tables for socializing and meeting people from around the world.  Later head down to the gym for a cardio workout or utilize the multiple free weights or machines to keep fit, even while your away.\n\nOf course you will want to go to the beach, so a 10 minute walk down 38 ave gets you right in the middle of one of the nicest beaches in Playa.  White sand and warm water will have you reaching for your camera for that postcard picture in paradise.\n\nJust a 5 minute walk from world famous 5th ave brings you to world class restaurants and shopping.  Bars, dancing and entertainment are endless here as there is something for everyone.\n\nAlso within a 30 minute drive of the Condo:\n\nMultiple golf courses\nCirque de soleil\nWet and Wild Cancun/Ventura Park\nXcaret, Xplor, and the new Xsenses\nXoximilco\nXel-ha (40 min)\nAkumal for snorkelling with turtles\n\nAfter all those activities and a long day you need one thing:  a quiet location so you can get a good nights sleep.  Lunada is close to the action but also tranquil and quiet.  Enjoy the comfy beds with quality bedding so you are rested to do it all again tomorrow.\n\nStay with us and and start creating your memories!\n\nFull access to rooftop pools and Jacuzzis.

The building, the design, and the upgrades were definitely oozing New Orleans meets luxe! The staff was so incredibly friendly and accommodating! They not only allowed me to check in a little earlier per request, my daughter stubbed her toe very very bad last night and we needed a quick first aid kit, and to the rescue they came within minutes! I am so happy I found The Natchez. My mom doesn’t even like New Orleans and is ready to come back strictly for The Natchez. Thank you guys!",

This luxury condominium is perfect for a family and friends get away. This property was built circa 1830 and has been beautifully renovated into luxury rental condominiums. This condo features high style with ample original art, photographs, and richly appointed furnishings. All of our countertops at The Natchez are custom made out of 200+ year heart pine timbers that were meticulously reclaimed during the renovation and restoration of this historic Greek Revival building.\n\nThis pool view 3 bedroom 3 bath unit is very comfortable at 1,500 sq ft and has its own private patio with private hot tub, and BBQ pit overlooking the courtyard, pool, and cabanas. It is often referred to as the “super unit” because, in addition to the the large patio deck, it has two additional private balconies. The living/ dining/kitchen are “open floor plan style” designed for socializing. All appliances are top of the line stainless steel. The unit is richly appointed with original paintings, art work, and local photography. The exposed brick walls in the living areas along with the large French doors blend with the modern furnishings and contemporary art. All bedrooms are richly appointed and have either a king size or queen size beds. The kitchen is equipped with glassware, plates, flatware, pots, pans, etc. Simply walk in, unpack your bags, and enjoy your trip-- everything else should already be taken care of. This unit is located on the 2nd floor overlooking the courtyard and pool. \n\nThe pool, grotto, cabanas, sun deck and the hot tubs are immediately accessible in the courtyard to the rear of the property. There are 4 hot tubs on the property: two of them are private to the two units that have their own private 2nd floor patio decks and 2 are available to all guests with both freshwater and saltwater options available for your enjoyment. Enjoy a midday or night dip in the swimming pool or lounge in the grotto. Sun bathe on the sun deck overlooking the pool or relax in the cabanas.\n\nFeel like kicking back and cooking at home?

Uno de mis escritores favoritos es Stephen King ya que toca temas cotidianos y de ellos saca historias magnificas. \r\nEn cuanto a los viajes, me gusta mucho ir a lugares fríos. Al vivir en Cancún, el calor se vuelve aburrido, pero no quiere decir que sea malo, ya que también me gusta la playa, pero prefiero los lugares con menos temperatura.\r\nOtra cosa que me podría distinguir mucho, es la música. Me encanta la música Rock y la clásica. Muchos de mis viajes han sido para ir algún concierto. Considero que con la música no hay que limitarse, si es necesario viajar, pues viajamos!!! ",

Desde hace 6 años he sido parte del equipo de diseño de los departamentos que rento, esto me llena de satisfacción personal y profesional.  \n\nI'm very enthusiastic about life, architecture and cats (I secretly love cats. Well, not so secretly). \nEverybody is welcome in my place and my country, which I would love to share. It's always a pleasure to share my work with the people I host. It's been three years now I have been part of the design team that built the departments I rent, it is VERY special for me to have guests enjoying their stays.\n",

There are also parks nearby with plenty of grass to walk the dog.  The binder Steven provided everything you needed to know about the house and Palm Springs (restaurants, places to visit...,).

The place was exactly the same - clean, welcoming, and comfortable. The hot 4th of July weather was tamed with excellent air conditioning and we got to try out some of the amenities including mini golf, the Tiki Bar, and River Park. (just be aware that on some days around July 4 the amenities aren't available to guests, but Carla went above and beyond to make sure we got to enjoy everything we had hoped). We expected the place to be buggy in the summer, but were pleasantly surprised to see no insects inside! Our dog had an awesome time exploring the property and also the Delaware at River Park. A really wonderful place to stay and enjoy activities or just lazing around. Definitely on our \"return again\" list. Thank you, Carla, for everything!",

      "about": "I'm an Australian born who moved back to Sydney after living in New York (in the coolest part of Williamsburg!) for nearly 3 years, studying Theatre Acting at HB Studio. Prior to this, I lived in London for 7 years. I have a Degree in Events management and also Diplomas in Graphic Design & Multimedia; and Fashion & Marketing. Although one day I hope to have my own little cafe, just because I'm obsessed with making coffee and the thought of being a full time barista wouldn't be a bad idea :)\r\nI've travelled alot (but it will never be enough), mostly in Europe, US and Asia. My last adventure was to Russia and I absolutely loved it.  \r\nI also enjoy cooking, dancing and doing DIY/ creating everything and anything!! I take great pride in been hospitable and been appreciated is the cherry on top of the cake.\r\n\nI've being an Airbnb member since 2011, both as a guest and a host. Through Airbnb, I have met many interesting people from all over the world. As a guest, the 3 most important things I look for is a place that's clean, safe and convenient to amenities/ transportation, and of course, that won't break my bank account. Keeping this in mind whilst being a host, I understand that communication is vital to guests as they want to be able to know their needs are met and that organising accommodation should be stress-free as travelling/moving homes can be overwhelming. Juggling between being a mum of 2 (bub and toddler), working part-time and being a Airbnb Plus/Super Host, I aim to provide my guests a comfortable and enjoyable stay, and hope you can walk away with a positive and memorable experience in Sydney, my hometown. My goal is to provide a “home away from home” feel to my guests. With the help of my hubby Evgeny and my brother Nick as my co-hosts, we’ve accommodated more than 1700 guests in Sydney since 2015. \r\nIn return, I would appreciate you taking a few minutes of your time to write a review on your experience staying with me. I enjoy being a host and I'm all ears to any suggestions as there is always room for improvements, so please feel free to message me as I would love to hear them. \r\n\r\nLook forward to being your host. \r\n\r\nTina :)",

Should you wish to smoke, there is a designated smoking area located on the ground floor of the building. Smoking in the apartment will incur an automatic penalty of AU$500.00.\n\nYou will be supplied with a set of keys to the studio apartment (with kitchenette and bathroom) and have access to the premises' common facilities including the lifts, laundry room (located on the same floor), smoking area and outdoor pool.\n\nPrivate apartment provides you the flexibility and convenience to explore and enjoy Sydney at ease.

Public transportations (includes trains, buses, light rail and ferries), Taxis, Uber, GoGet and car rentals are readily available in the immediate vicinity.

There are limited free street - parking available after 10pm and before 8am. I highly recommend using public trains/buses/ferry to get around, however, Uber/ Taxify, taxis and GoGet are other options (for Uber use promo: uberTinan37 for first timers and save $5 or for Taxify: HX47Q and you can save $10 on your first ride).

We had everything we needed, the bed was very comfy and the TV had lots of channels.\n The pool was out of this world, it was salted water rather than chlorine and felt very clean and clear. The pool was a perfect place to relax when it got too hot - there is a very good sunshade covering most of the pool, so you can brave the sun if you want, or stay in the shade and keep cool.\n We met Bill on the second day, and he was very pleasant to speak to. He offered advice on good places to eat, which we took him up on.\n It was a truly wonderful holiday and we would definitely return in a heartbeat.",

Not worth the money- Room was quite dark and had a strong urine or cat litter odour. \nIt was impossible to sleep when it rained as the rain drops where heavy; and with the room being somewhat of a basement, the noise was unbearable. \n\nHost was not helpful and instead threatened to “send his guys” to throw us out when we just wanted to resolve a refund/booking dispute. This was even after explaining that I’m new to the Airbnb platform. \nEnded up cutting the stay short and host agreed to a refund at least. \nTerrible experience.",

Heel last-minute konden wij nog terecht in het verblijf van Simon, zonder enige problemen. Er werd heel snel gereageerd en we waren meteen welkom. Het huis is zeer schoon en opgeruimd, ligt in een prachtige rustige omgeving en heeft een groot zwembad, welke je met maar een paar van de andere huizen van het resort deelt. Simon is echt een zeer fijne host en reageert erg snel, dat is super. Verder worden er hele fijne tips gegeven over bijvoorbeeld wat er te doen is in de buurt, over de check-in en over supermarkten in de buurt. Wij zijn heel tevreden en komen zeker nog eens terug! Hou er wel rekening mee dat de airconditioning werkt door er 1 of 2 euromunten in te doen dus zorg dat je deze bij je hebt!",

It’s only 1€ for about 2 hours and you really only need it for a few hours at night in the peak of summer as the fans work really well. \n(We did get 8 hours for our last 2€)\n\nIt’s an easy 5 min downhill walk into Xlendi which is our favourite place in all of Malta - and we’ve been just about everywhere now.\nVictoria is really close to visit but you feel like you are miles from anywhere in Xlendi.",

That is, each time, a search of harmony and beauty that splint the wildest and most timeless projects. Through his creations, home, garden, hotel, shop or event, Xavier Nicod shaping the scene plays on the contrast of cultures and meaning, by daring to overcome the limitations of conventional decorative aesthetics.\r\n\r\nWith the desire to share his universe, Xavier Nicod opened in September 2017 its guest rooms in Provence, in a discreet and authentic village of Luberon, places where nature and selected objects are used to sample the audacity, beauty and poetry as a way of life.\r\n\r\nDepuis plus de 30 ans, l’espace Xavier Nicod poursuit la recherche permanente de l’objet comme une oeuvre, qu’il soit populaire ou précieux. C’est, à chaque fois, une quête d’harmonie et d’esthétique qui s’attelle aux projets les plus fous et les plus intemporels. A travers ses créations, maison, jardin, hôtel, boutique ou événement, Xavier Nicod façonne les lieux, joue sur le contraste des cultures et du sens, en osant dépasser les limites de l’esthétique décorative conventionnelle.\r\n\r\nAvec l'envie de partager son univers, Xavier Nicod a ouvert en septembre 2017 ses chambres d'hôtes en Provence, dans un village discret et authentique du Luberon, des lieux où la nature  et les objets sélectionnés permettent de goûter à l'audace, la beauté et la poésie comme un art de vivre.",

Der kleine Balkon der Wohnung ist ein Traum. Die Sicht auf die alte Mühle von Goult ... (zum Schmelzen). Die Lage ist absolut ruhig. Ausser einem Pfau den man ab und zu beim Château de Goult sehen, kann hört man nichts. Der Indoor-Pool muss man selber erleben. Die ganze Anlage ist wie ein Brocant in \"L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue\". \n\nXavier ist ein super lieber Typ. Immer für einen Spass zu haben. Die Wohnung können wir allen empfehlen, die offen für neues sind. Wir kommen wieder!",

They are modern and spacious, you have plenty of beach items at your disposal, and the private pool area is beautiful. Having private parking in this area is also fantastic, and you’re a short drive to Wailea, many beaches and lots of food options. We walked to dinner and lunch often, and to nearby beaches too. Having this place to call home during our trip made it so much more relaxing. We can’t wait to return and stay here again!",

The living room is smaller than advertised so being all together in there was a bit of a squeeze. Some portions of the home were also not like in the pictures. A missing living room table, a few things missing from rooms (decoration wise), no cushions on outside seating, and many tiles in the pool seem to have fallen and noticeably replaced. Sacha will message you more in depth details about the rental after submitting payment that I wish were public prior to renting out the home since there is no refund. Besides that, the backyard has a great grass area for a dog,  the rooms and bathrooms were very nicely cleaned, pool towels were available for all 6 guests, and kitchen is fully stocked with supplies and spices. This home is in a quiet neighborhood which we pleasantly enjoyed that is not too far from shopping centers and markets. Great location and home that just needs a few upgrades. :)",

      "about": "I am a super upbeat and positive outgoing individual. You will always find me with a smile on my face.  :)  I love building relationships and learning new things. I especially love to learn how I can better myself and expand my horizons.   One of my passions is building awesome and exciting memories with my family and friends.  Every year we set plans for new countries to explore and adventure to embark on.  If there were a few things I could not live without it would be faith, family, traveling, music, good food, and good tequila.  One of my favorite adventures I have done with four friends was a three week crazy motorcycle ride from New Delilah to the highest motor-able road in the world in the Himalayas.  We literally rode for 10-12 hours per day through some insane weather condition,  rivers, and off road terrains.  It still all feels like a dream.   \r\n\r\nAs a guest I am super clean and respectful of the space.  I more then likely will not be around since I live to be out throughout the day exploring the town. Overall, I am low maintenance and very respectful of other peoples property. \r\n\r\nAs a host, I love to provide the best experience as possible by upholding high standards.  I enjoy interacting with my guests but also respect privacy and provide space. My goal is to be a resource to help provide the best experience possible by being helpful in any way.  I love to joke around so I might be silly at times, but with my intent to build a fun relationship and great experience.  I am also flexible and firm if need to be.\r\n\r\nMy life motto:  I believe that we all have the ability to \"Create Your Waves\"  We are in control of our destiny and its all a mindset.  The story that we tell ourselves that either hold us back or help us move forward and live our ideal life. I personally choose to always be authentic and optimistic.",

It is in the heart of Zona Romantica and is very walkable to many popular restaurants, beaches, and cafes.  The space was beautifully decorated and stylish. The unit is very spacious and we loved having an in-unit washer/dryer.  The rooftop pool was beautiful but was sometimes crowded with other residents/ guests and hard to find seating. \n\nDago was a bit hard to get in touch with prior to our reservation regarding local recommendations and confirming arrival time, but we did not need much assistnce as check in was easy and seamless with provided instructions.  We would highly recommend staying at Dago's if visiting Puerto Vallarta.\n\nThanks for hosting us!",

LOL I love that we had complimentary water, since it was scorching hot in June. Lord knows I love picking off season for that great deal. ha! Each room had its own air conditioning as well as a fan. Our Host DAGO was amazing! He's responsive, extremely nice, and cordial. I would definitely like to rent from him again. Aside from the condo being beautiful it was literally walking distance to everything. If you have a chance you should really stop by one of our favorite bar called Bar la Playa. Craft cocktails and awesome vibes.",

The rooftop pool is outstanding with a great 360 view of the Athens and a good sight line to Acropolis.  We enjoyed some hours swimming and taking photos into the pool from the living room.  The apartment is a 5min walk to the metro so you have easy access to the rest of the city.  In addition, the taverna next door is very good so if you don’t feel like venturing out for a night you have dinner close to the apartment.  The only downside is that neighborhood is kind of noisy and run down but the apartment more than makes up for it.  I would highly recommend this unique experience to anyone traveling to Athens.",

The plus side to this apartment was the 2 bedrooms with private bathrooms, the elevator to all 3 floors of the apartment, the cleanliness of the place and of course the private swimming pool. If I ever come back to Athens, which I plan to do in the future, I pray this apartment will still be available to rent because I would stay here again in a heartbeat. The Host responded to every one of my messages with a quick response, if I ever needed anything. The only negative which has nothing to do with the apartment, was the time of year I was there due to the high heat and the music venue extremely nearby that played loud music until midnight most of the nights we were there. Most of the time it was okay, when we weren’t in the room trying to sleep. But on the few nights we wanted to sleep we couldn’t do it until after the music ended. But even that is minor. The apartment was perfect!!",

Erick and his co-hosts were very responsive, and also gave us great recommendations when we were looking for specific things to do in the city. The apartment was very spacious, including great closet space and a nice shower. They provided a fan to help keep the space cool. It was not noisy at night, and we felt safe walking around even late at night as the nearby streets were well-lit. It's overall in a great area of CDMX, there were plenty of bars, restaurants, and cafe's open nearby. Most of the major sights in the city were walking distance from the apartment. The building had several amenities that we didn't have time to take advantage of. The building has a doorman, and you will be asked to send ID photos of all your guests after booking to share with the building. We'd definitely stay here again the next time we visit!",

After dating for two and a half years, we got married the day after our final exam.  Katie began working at a marketing firm, while I began working as a CPA for a large public accounting firm.  After 4 years in Cincinnati, I took a job opportunity to audit hedge funds in the Cayman Islands.  This incredible experience formed us in many ways by  cementing our relationship and giving us the confidence that we could do anything together.  We left Cayman in order to start a family back in the States in 2012, and we now have four amazing kids - Giorgio, Decker, Pfeiffer, and Covey.  We believe family is one of the greatest tools God gives us in order to change the world. \r\n\r\nTo sum up what we are all about, it's  adventure, togetherness, and impact.  \r\n\r\nWhen my wife and I were starting our family, we decided to quit our corporate jobs and focus on quality over quantity.  Since then our life has been filled with adventure through travel, new experiences, business ventures, relationships, and a willingness to do what others think is crazy.  \"Adventure\" to us really means being \"doers\" by acting on our ideas.\r\n\r\nTogetherness is a huge part of what our family is about as we integrate our whole family into our work, our education, our faith, our hobbies, and all we do.  We work from home to be around our kids, we homeschool together, we travel together, and, generally, any other task from grocery shopping to working out is an opportunity to spend time together.\r\n\r\nWhen Katie was pregnant with our first child in 2013, we decided to write a family mission statement to help give us direction in decisions big and small.  The gist of our mission statement is to change the world by making it more like heaven.  We do our best to make the world a better place by spreading love.\r\n\r\nWe hope that helps you get to know us a little better, but we'd love to get to know you more in person!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nBrent, Katie, Gio, Decker, Pfeiffer, and Covey!\n",

Access through the garage was simple and great since it rained and we could pull our car into the garage. There was enough pots and pans to cook and ample prep space.  We were able to do laundry. And It’s very close to Kings Island with a Kroger down the street. \n\nThe hosts were very courteous, proactively sent instructions/reminders, and quick to response. \n\nLoveland is an excellent place to stay.",

    "summary": "Laze away an evening swaying in a macrame hammock in a living room with a Moroccan vibe. Make breakfast in a sparkling white kitchen and snuggle together on a cozy banquette.\n\nThe bedroom has a new memory foam queen mattress.  The family room has a pull-out couch with a queen mattress.  The eating area feels like a diner with a built in banquette.  The Kitchen is charming and bright.  A washer and dryer are available in the home.  The bathroom is newly updated with concrete tile and gold fixtures.  The home has an attached garage for your use.\n\nThe guest house is completely detached from the main house, but it does share a driveway with our main residence.  The guest house also has an attached two car garage that can be used by guests.\n\nWe love getting to know new people!  Because the guest house is so close to our main house, we are always available for questions or help.  On nice nights we'd be happy to have drinks around the fire.  We're very friendly and would love to connect, but we also fully respect privacy and discretion for guests that just want to get away from it all.\n\nThe Land of Love House is in the city of Loveland, 30 minutes northeast of Central Cincinnati. It's a wonderful neighborhood with great restaurants and attractions including Kings Island, Beach Waterpark, Great Wolf Lodge, and ATP Tennis Tournament.\n\nThe Land of Love house is located near everything a good suburb has to offer - restaurants, shopping, grocery, and (of course) Target are all within a 5 minute drive of the house.  Historic downtown Loveland and the bike path are less than 10 minutes away, best accessed by vehicle.\n\nDuring the week of your stay we will send you a welcome letter with everything you need to know about the house.  It’s all pretty straightforward though.  :)",

      "about": "I live in East Nashville. I moved here from Los Angeles 4 years ago and absolutely fell in love with Nashville.  Nashville is wonderfully supportive community: Wonderful food, friends, and lots of warm hello's. People here have a real authenticity and kindness. \r\n\r\nI decided to Airbnb because I love to travel. It is one of my passions. I have been all over the world and love the idea hosting people in this great city. It brings me great joy for people to come here and feel welcomed as I felt welcome in all the other countries I have traveled to.\r\n\r\nI was originally born in South Carolina and am a Southern girl at heart though I have lived in NYC and LA for over 20 years. However I have never lost my love for hospitality. We take great pride in hospitality and I want everyone to feel comfortable, relaxed, and welcome in our cottage. \r\n\r\nI do have a 9 year old son and we are in and out more in the summer but please say hello if you see us. IF you have any questions don't hesitate to ask. \r\n\r\nMy life motto is CARPE DIEM. This life is a gift and I am so grateful every day for the many many blessings. ",

    "summary": "Welcome to your historic rural oasis on the outskirts of Pioneertown. Showcased in the NY Times fashion section, the property features a rock hot tub or cool dipping pool surrounded by cactus gardens and the Sawtooth mountains. Just minutes from Pappy & Harriet’s in Pioneertown and replete with original art by the late Gerald Zeldin, custom furniture, and a grand piano. Also close to Joshua Tree park and the amenities of Yucca Valley. The historic mining property of The Ranch of The Rising Sun was designed and restored as a completely off-grid haven by filmmakerJulian T Pinder.\n\nThe Ranch of the Rising Sun, a mining base camp built in the 1920's,  is the perfect balance of rustic charm and modern amenities. Off grid on a full solar system and water well, the home also provides high speed wifi, state of the art cooling and heating systems on a smart NEST thermostat, flatscreen tv with Netflix, Amazon etc, new top of the line oven / stovetop, vintage sound system with Bluetooth capabilities, keyless door entry etc. \n\nGuests have access to the entire house and property, including the wood burning stove (eucalyptus firewood is provided at all times free of cost), cowboy wood burning hot tub / cool dipping pool, grand piano, native cactus garden, fire pit, outdoor banquet dining table, hammock, alkaline drinking water, and some of the best hiking in the area right out the back door.\n\nThe house and property are also right off of Pioneertown Road, with no long rough dirt roads to navigate and beat your car up on.\n\nThe ranch was built and owned by Julian Pinder, who has lived in the area for years. Rent from locals, not out-of-town investors!\n\nEntire house and property, as well as endless hiking and adventuring right behind the house on thousands of acres of stunning Wildlands Conservancy land, no tourists or park fees to deal with, just old fashioned exploring!\n\nThere are detailed self-check in instructions. Tyler, my friend and property manager lives nearby and I'm 5 miles away at my other ranch. We respect your privacy 100% but if you need any advice, help, or have any questions we are always available by text or phone 24 hours a day.\n\nPioneertown was built in the late 40's as a functioning movie set by Roy Rogers and the Sons of Pioneers; hundreds of Westerns have been shot here. Catch live music at Pappy and Harriets, minutes away, and go hiking and horseriding out the back door.\n\nUnfortunately you'll need a vehicle out here, it's rural!\n\n*There's a very strict maximum of 4 guests in the house as the solar and septic system cannot handle any more than that.",

We took many day trips exploring most of the island and getting to the other side of the island only took 1 1/2 hours. We used the snorkeling gear and towels nearly daily which were wonderful to have. We cooked all meals in the condo, everything worked great and it met all of our needs. It was wonderful coming home to AC and a shower after a long day of exploring. We would definitely return to Jenna’s place the next time we visit Hawai’i.",

Decor was super cute, and we appreciated the thoughtful touches such as makeup wipes. Location could not be beat! So close to Main Street, so we were able to park upon arrival to Breck and walk everywhere during our stay. Jack & Jerrod were communicative and provided clear instructions (with photos!) with directions for parking and check-in, which was really helpful. Would definitely stay here again!",

    "summary": "This adorable studio is perfectly located right at the ski lift and in the heart of Breckenridge. It has a fully equipped kitchen, massive bathroom , smart TV, and cool design features like vintage ski photos and reclaimed barn wood wall. There is a comfy king bed and a pullout sofa. The building has all the amenities: brand-new pool, hot tubs, game room and gym (new pics coming). Park in the heated garage ($20/day) and walk to everything.\n\nTHE CONDO\nThis is a 400 square foot one-room studio located on the fourth floor. It has a king-sized bed and a queen-size pull-out couch with memory foam mattress (it's still not the most comfortable thing but does the deed). There is TV with cable, a small closet, two-person breakfast bar, fully equipped kitchen with stove, fridge, freezer, microwave, coffeemaker, etc. The bathroom has double sinks, and bathtub/shower, separate toilet room. There are many cool design features such as reclaimed barnwood wall, slate bathroom tile, wood floors, vintage ski photos, stacked stone backsplash, stainless steel appliances, and walnut counters. The unit looks out to a courtyard area. It's perfect for a couple or a few close friends/family members as it's basically the size of a normal hotel room. It is very very quiet as it is in a concrete building sharing only the bathroom/kitchen wall with nobody above. \n\nTHE BUILDING\nThe Village at Breckenridge is a large complex of several buildings. This unit is located in Peak 9 Inn which has heated underground parking (additional fee), conference center, mini convenience store, business center, an indoor/outdoor pool, four hot tubs, steam room, sauna, and minimal workout room. There is a ski shop downstairs for rentals..\n\nGuests will have access to the entire studio and the building amenities including pool, hot tubs, and gym.\n\nWe live in Denver so likely won't see you but are available by text or phone to answer questions, give recommendations, or help with any issues. We cannot guarantee 24/7 service.\n\nThe location doesn't get any better than this! It is located 1/2 block off of Main Street, which makes it within easy walking distance of  shops, grocery stores, bars, and restaurants. It is right at the base of Peak 9, just a few steps from the Quicksilver lift in the Village at Breckenridge.\n\nOnce you get here, you won't need a car. You can walk to dining, shopping, grocery, and skiing. There are also free town shuttles. The nearby free Summit Stage will take you to Keystone, Copper, ABasin. Take a shuttle from the airport (Colorado Mountain Express) and never need a car!\n\nPARKING CHARGES\nParking is NOT INCLUDED. It is an additional $20/day, let me know when you book and I will alter the reservation to add it. \n\nCHECK-IN PROCESS \nMuch of this building is managed by Vail Resorts and it has a traditional front desk, valet, etc. Because we rent our unit on our own, we are able to provide a better pricing than Vail (and it's cooler than their units). But, the front desk and valet are not available to our guests. You will access garage by getting key card and parking pass from a lockbox located in the garage.\n\n\nMISC NOTES\nThere is no air conditioning in summer, but you rarely need it. No balcony. No fireplace.",

Great furnishings and several little inviting outdoor areas to gather. The pool is lovely but cold which is probably welcome in warmer weather but I wish I had asked for it to be heated which must be done in advance. \n\nThere is also some additional paperwork required presumably by the City of Palm Springs  that I found to be a nuisance and made me a little uncomfortable that there might be sensitivities by the neighbors to having renters in their neighborhood. We had three cars to manage with rules that they couldn't be parked on the street and getting in and out was a bit of a hassle. Small things to be aware of but really nothing that will impact the enjoyment of your stay. \n\nWe truly enjoyed our time there with our two grown sons and would definitely stay there again. It was a relaxing and great Airbnb experience.",

    "house_rules": "House Rules :\nPalm Springs recently implemented a strict CODE OF CONDUCT for short term tenants and home owners. By breaking the rules below tenants may be subject to city fines upwards of $3,000, eviction and loss of security deposit. Please help us keep Palm Springs vacation renter friendly! \n\n- Noise Detection :  We use “NOISEAWARE” a noise detecting (not recording) system popular with short term rental owners that sends alerts when outside noise reaches levels considered by the city to be unacceptable / citation worthy. A $250 fine for noise violations will be implemented on the first violation. A second detection is grounds for removal from the property. This includes children at play and loud pool splashing during the day.  \n\n- AGE REQUIREMENT : Palm Springs city ordinance requires that the responsible person occupying the home (i.e., the person making the booking) be at least 25 years old. Booking guest MUST be present during length of stay. \n\n- A mandatory 12.5% occupancy tax will be applied to every stay under 28 days and collected at check out via an Airbnb money request \n\n- Absolutely NO parties : An unauthorized party or event at the property will lead to your immediate removal from the property. The city of Palm Springs has strict vacation rental ordinances regarding parties and any violation can result in fines up to $3,000. ONLY 6 PEOPLE are allowed on the property at any time. \n\n- No amplified outdoor music at ANY TIME. Palm Springs city ordinance prohibits amplified exterior noise. Additionally indoor amplified music should not be heard at property line. THIS IS STRICKLY ENFORCED and includes LAPTOPS, CELLPHONES and blasting the TV so you can hear it outside. \n\n- Maximum Occupancy is 6 (strictly enforced) – Again, Palm Springs has strict rules regarding occupancy. If more than 6 people are to found to be staying at the house security deposit will be forfeited and all guests will be asked to leave. \n\n- Noise Curfew : 10pm exterior noise curfew. Palm Springs city ordinance requires that outdoor noise be limited to 40 decibels after 10pm -- equivalent to a soft whisper.\n\n- Smoking : This is a Non-Smoking House. If evidence of smoking is found indoors, entire security deposit will be retained for additional cleaning.\n\n- PETS : Pre-approved, well behaved pets are allowed on the property but not on the furniture or beds. If pets are found to have been on the property without prior approval, security deposit will be forfeited. There is $75/day PER pet cleaning fee - 2 pet max. \n\n- Pool Rules : Guests agree to have a responsible adult supervising minors while they swim in the pool. Guest is hereby notified that the pool can be dangerous and guest accepts fully the risks involved. By booking this rental the guest agrees to this. Our pool is shallow and contains a raise shelf. There is absolutely NO DIVING. \n\n- No Glass : Glass is not allowed near the pool (including beer bottles, glass water bottles etc.) plastic dishware is available for use and is located in the kitchen cabinet to the right of the sink. \n\nBy continuing to book all guests agree to follow rules and abide by statements made above. The guest booking our house will be required to read the Palm Springs \"Good Neighbor Guide\", email a copy of their government ID and have all guest staying at the house sign their names to the Palm Springs \"Rules and Regulations\" form. \n \nThank you.",

Steps away from top class cafes, exciting restaurants and beautiful rice field walks, and yet unbelievably peaceful and quiet at the same time. We had planned on visiting so many different spots for breakfast but that all changed when we went to Seniman cafe on the first day and we realised we were having some of the best coffee and food Bali has on offer. The yoga space was perfect for relaxing and enjoying a wine or just as a space to plot the next day’s adventures from. Parwati was an amazing host and really did make us feel safe and at home in the Villa. Her recommendation of using Satya as a driver was fantastic. We used his services on three separate occasions and can’t recommend him highly enough. Do yourself a favour and book this Villa now. You won’t be disappointed.",

The best coffee in Ubud (Seniman) is right across the road and we enjoyed breakfast there every morning. If you enjoy vegan food there is a good vegan pizza place about 100m up the road and Hujan local (fine dining) is also about 50m away. Alternatively for budget friendly food Fair Warung Bale provides good food for a worthy cause providing free health care for someone in need for each meal purchased. Although the Villa is in the centre of Ubud it is a peaceful and quiet space to return to in the evening. I would definitely recommend.",

Mas quanto mais divulgar, mais ajudaremos a combater: fomos roubados por um taxista! Existe uma quadrilha que fica próximo ao SKY Costaneira! Eles adulteram o taxímetro e ao invés de girar a cada 150 pesos, gira para 1500 pesos! Para terem uma ideia: uma corrida q por uber custaria 2300 pesos, pagamos 26 mil pesos! Tentamos questionar, mas ficamos com medo. CUIDADO! Meu conselho: usem uber! \n\nMas o apto é ótimo e vale a estadia!",

    "summary": "Travel back in time in this mid-century design garden house with mountain views. The home boasts original architectural features, retro furnishings and decor contrasted with modern amenities, a BBQ patio, and a covered outdoor ping-pong table. \n\nAs of August 2020, a cemented outdoor patio and breakfast area have been added to the home.\n\nShort term rental permit #066151\n\nLooking for a getaway? What better place than The Crest! This little paradise is located in a beautiful and quiet palm tree lined neighborhood with stunning dramatic views of the Santa Rosa Mountains. \n\nMany of our neighbors have lived in the community a very long time. Just take a slow drive down our main street or take a walk around the neighborhood and you’ll see why. You are in another world.\n\nThe home is lusciously landscaped with exotic varieties of desert plants and mature trees and the oasis-like pool area invites a sense of relaxation and peace. \n\nTake a nap, read a book or enjoy the views from your tree-hanging hammock or have a cup of coffee in your peaceful breakfast nook. \nThe home has a very bright and open layout. The custom floral double entry doors that were imported from South America are stunning and unique. The home is beautifully appointed with bamboo wood flooring throughout. Inside the living area, you will notice the tasteful and inviting mid-century eco-modern design and mango wood furnishings that are popular in today’s living.\n\nThe entire house is accessible except for a few locked closets that store our maintenance supplies. The garage is accessible for washer/dryer use only. Please park your cars in the driveway. Additional parking should only be next to the house.\n\nCheck-in is simple. There is a keyless entry system on the property and you will be provided a personal passcode before your arrival.\n\nI will also be available via phone/text/email if any questions or concerns arise. Please don't hesitate to reach out!\n\nOur home is located near the intersection of Hwy 111 and Point Happy, and is considered by some, to be the western gateway to La Quinta. Our small Highland Palms community consists of less than 100 homes that were built in the early '60s and '70s.\n\nThe best part about the neighborhood is its location. You won't find a better one! It provides the perfect balance of peace and quiet while also being centrally located to everything! It's all at your fingertips. You are walking and biking distance to great restaurants, theatres, shopping and are 1.5 miles away from the Indian Wells Tennis Gardens. You are also within short driving distance to world class Golfing, Hiking Trails, Casinos and the Empire Polo Grounds- home to the Coachella and Stagecoach Festivals.\n\nAround Town:\n* Coachella Music & Arts Festival (5.9 miles)\n* Indian Wells Tennis Garden (1.4 miles)\n* Downtown Palm Springs (22 miles)\n* Old Town La Quinta (2.7 miles)\n* Fred Wolff Bear Creek Nature Preserve (4.3 miles)\n* La Quinta Resort and Club (2 miles)\n* SilverRock Resort (3.6 miles)\n* La Quinta Museum (3.1 miles)\n* Cliff House Restaurant (0.7 miles)\n* PGA West (6.5 miles)\n* Lake Cahuilla (9.8 miles)\n*Sunnylands (11 miles)\n* Agua Caliente Resort & Spa Casino (12 miles)\n* Fantasy Springs Casino-Indio (8.5 miles)\n* El Paseo Shopping District-Palm Desert (5.9 miles)\n* The Living Desert Zoo-Palm Desert (7 miles)\n* Palm Springs Aerial Tramway (29 miles)\n* Joshua Tree National Park (37 miles)\n\nShort Term Vacation Rental Permit #766151\n\nThe City of La Quinta has a mandatory 10% transient occupancy tax (TOT) for short term vacation rentals.

Excellent communication prior and during our trip with very wonderful, nice and accommodating staff. The room was immaculate, and the high ceilings made the already large room feel even more spacious and luxurious. Our kids enjoyed the rooftop pool every day.  The location is within walking distance to the Born and Gotic neighborhoods, while also having public transport nearby should you need it. We will not hesitate to stay here again the next time we are lucky enough to visit Barcelona!",

This location was surprisingly quiet. Our son was playing in a basketball tournament and we didn't know if had to book 4 days or more. After the fourth day, we requested an extended stay and our host were most gracious in allowing us one more night to enjoy the apartment. Good location for non-chain restaurants. The apartment was clean on our arrival. It's a simple residence if you're not into anything real fancy. Neighbors were quiet and friendly during our stay. I would definitely return to the townhouse in the future. Our host responded almost immediately when we made requests.",

    "summary": "Sink into the comfortable sofa in the bright, open living area, or head out into the private courtyard with built-in seating. This postwar complex was designed by Ralph Haver, featuring a Spanish style with tasteful refinement and designer touches.\n\nWith two bedrooms, two bathrooms, and approximately 1,100 sq. ft. of living space, this updated townhome is a perfect retreat in Central Phoenix.  Located within minutes from many amenities, this is an ideal home base for your stay in Phoenix.\n\nAll of the interior is light, bright, clean, and up to date.  Relax in an open living area with TV (local channels, plus HBO), WiFi, streaming video player, and ample seating.  Both bedrooms boast comfy foam mattresses, new furnishings, and en suite bathrooms.  Enjoy a cup of coffee, a book, or the weather in your private courtyard with built-in bench seating.\n\nThe kitchen includes all stainless appliances, a Keurig coffee maker (just get your favorite K-Cups), basic kitchen appliances, and most everything you'd need to either cook at home or enjoy delivery from any of the great nearby restaurants.\n\nOur townhome is one of only 38 residences on a private drive.  It's very quiet and many neighbors have lived there for years.  Enjoy a dip in the community pool which is just steps from your front door (our community pool, like most others in the area, is not heated).\n\nYou'll have the entire townhome just for you and your guests.  The community has an outdoor pool (not heated) and barbecue area (charcoal grills) and a key is provided in the townhome.\n\nWe have a washer and dryer provided inside the townhome. It’s easily accessible from a closet in the kitchen area.\n\nWe once lived in this home, but have relocated just a few blocks away.  You may contact us with any questions before, during, or after your stay.  We love the area and are happy to provide recommendations!  Check in/out is self-service, so you can also come and go without ever talking to us.  Steve, who helps us manage our bookings, might also respond to your questions or provide assistance, if needed.\n\nWe take hosting seriously, and are a proud #HostfullyHost. This means when you stay with us, you will get a personalized Hostfully guidebook. In it, you will find important information about our home, as well as our favorite local recommendations. It’s easy to navigate, and you can access it from your phone or desktop.\n\nThe townhouse is one of only 38 residences on a private drive. It's very quiet and provides easy access to major freeways and attractions. There is a variety of dining, cocktail, and brewery options within a mile of the home.\n\nOur neighborhood has a Walk Score of 62 out of 100, so some errands can be accomplished on foot.  Uber and Lyft are easy and affordable methods of transportation in this area.  If you're planning to rent a car, there are two parking spaces available in the unit's covered carport and additional parking nearby.  There is also convenient access to public transit, taxi, and bike lanes.\n\nOur major cross streets are 12th St. and Missouri Ave. If you’d like to estimate the distance or travel time to/from our home, we suggest that you look up “Virginia G. Piper Charitable Trust” as the location in your favorite map app.",

    "summary": "Enjoy stunning, unobstructed views of the Breck peaks - even from your king bed - from the 5th-floor – Inn at Peak 9.\n\nYou will feel like you are in a mountain retreat but you will be downtown Breck. \n\nThe building is in the Village and offers fantastic amenities. My favorite is the indoor/outdoor pool that is surrounded by outdoor hot tubs. There is also a sauna, steam, games, fitness center, pool table and more. (Pool closed thru 5/18).\n\nParking Optional: $15/night",
    "space": "STUNNING VIEWS\n\nThe condo is decorated Colorado cool. Cabin feeling with real wood on the walls in the setting area and around the bar with solid slab granite counters and stainless-steel appliances, full size frig, dishwasher, oven/stove, and micro. Faux-cedar wood flooring.\n\nEnjoy a steaming cup of coffee, while you watch the rising sun light up the peaks from this cabin-feel condo with beautiful CO pine paneling. You will be tempted to chill, but the mountains will be calling.\n\nYou will be downtown, so everything is within walking distance.\n\nThe Inn at Peak 9 is a Vail property, so it is managed to the highest standards.  There is also a 24x7 front desk that is run by Vail, the staff will be helpful but they don't manage this unit and won't be able to assist with any issues.\n\nSki-IN and OUT. At the end of the day, stop at The Maggie, next to the Quick Silver lift…great après ski place.\n\nComplete upgrade of FITNESS, HOT TUBS, STEAM, SAUNA, INDOOR/OUTDOOR POOL. You'll love it!\n\nCONDO DETAILS\nFaux cedar plank flooring and rustic wood for the cabin feel.\n\nMost units have a queen-size bed. Mine has a king-size bed (Tuft and Needle MINT, their best mattress - comparable with Casper, Purple and the other new style of premium mattresses).\n\nThe 2nd bed is a very high-end sofa bed.  Memory foam mattress that is an over-sized queen. And no removing the cushions – with a single pull, the bed folds out and all of the cushions stay attached and are neatly out of the way. \n\nFully furnished (including the kitchen with cookware and utensils), with upgraded linens.\n\nLarge locker just outside your door for skis and boots.\n\nNewly renovated Fitness Center. Indoor/outdoor pool, outdoor hot tubs, fitness center, sauna, steam, large shard area with fireplace, pool table, and games.\n\nDOWNTOWN BRECK\nYou are downtown, in the Village, the only SKI-IN/OUT in downtown Breck. You will not need a car once you arrive.\n\nThe Inn at Peak Nine is in the Village, in town...and believe me, you want to be in town. Views, in town, ski-in & out...what else could you want?\n\n\nPARKING\nParking is available for an additional charge (we only pass along our cost), heated and underground. There are a limited number of parking places, but generally parking is available when booked ahead, but we cannot guarantee until we have your reservation.\n\nAt the bottom of the Quick Silver lift and in town, you won't need a car. Our Breck Guide includes a discount codes for shuttles to/from DIA and equipment rental.\n\n\nNOTES:\n- Sorry but ANIMALS ARE NOT ALLOWED per HOA rules including Emotional Support Animals.\n- There is a \"kiddie cage\" available for the little ones. There may be a charge of $20 for delivery. \n- Pay-per-use laundry is available on the same floor, it uses an app.\n- My property manager (Carol) is local and is only a call/text away. And the front desk is staffed 24/7 for emergencies.\n- Our Breck Guide includes discount codes for shuttles to/from DIA and equipment rental.\n\nADDITIONAL CONDO\nIn addition to this listing, I have another in downtown Breck on AirBNB. One bedroom that overlooks the river, mid-town. To view it, use this number (18121409) after /rooms/ in the URL.",

    "house_rules": "1-  No Parties. Quiet hours are 10pm-7am.  If the desk gets a complaint, you must comply.  If they get a 2nd complaint, you will be asked to leave, and you will forfeit your damage deposit.  \n2- No smoking of any kind, including pot, and including the balcony.\n3-If Sleeper sofa was used, please leave open so that we know it has been used.\n4-Please leave keys and parking pass on the counter (failure to leave keys and pass will be $25 per key and pass).\n5-You must specify the number of overnight guests in your reservation. If you plan to host other people,  you must let us know how many additional visitors you expect in addition to the overnight guests.\n6-There are community laundry facilities in the building that are coin-operated.  Apparently AirBNB is not communicating that it is coin-operated.  As a host, we only have the choice to select laundry is available for a fee, but apparently that information is not made available to guests.\n7-Parking is extra.  Shuttles are a great option from DIA, and we have a discount code for you on our Breck Guide on the MountainsAndSea website. There is a nightly fee for parking (we charge only our cost - see listing for amount, if changes based on the time of year). You must request, parking is not guaranteed but we have never had a problem with reserving in advance.\n8-Only service animals are allowed - dogs and miniature horses (funny, we know, but this is Colorado) .  Not our rule, it is the building policy.\n9-For COVID protection of the cleaning crew, please place the sheets and towels that were used on the bathroom floor, so they can be collected with less risk.",

I try to get to my oasis in Tulum as much as possible but open it up to you to enjoy whenever I’m not there. \r\nMy co-hosts, Yana and Esteban, are there to greet you and take care of your every need.

We went to the Tulum Ruins, Gran Cenote, Cenote Cristaline and Yalku Lagoon. We would definitely come back again! It was a girls trip with my best friend and our 14 year old daughters. We had a blast and felt completely safe at night. The girls loved the pool too!",

The nearest place to buy anything is an Oxxo near the monument.  \n\nI agree with what others have said about the pool/gym reservations. The top floor is split into 2 separate sides one is the pool and one is the gym. You have to reserve either one in hour long blocks at the front desk. Depending on which worker is manning the desk on the top it can get weird. Asking us if we showered and make sure we have our swim caps etc.  These rules about reservations and limiting 2 people per room to the pool only seem to apply to the AirBNB guests. For the purpose of keeping things quiet for the full time residents. The views from the top floor are incredible day or night. \n\nThere were trumpet and drum players down by the monument 5/7 days at varying times of day sometimes blasting for hours. \n\nThe beds were not Queen size they were only full. No AC but the fans helped with open windows.",

Luckily was not in the unit for much of the time in the city, so the restroom and A/C were not a big deal. Bonus was the building staff being very helpful and friendly.

It was our dream to live in an actual Castle, so we studied it with the best architects and we created a real Castle made out of stone and recycled materials. Hence the name Four Seasons Stonework Castle.\nWe lived there for 18 years. My sons grew up in this house as did we (me and my husband) so, after all these years, we decided to move to the city in order to have everything closer. That meant that we had to make something out of our dream. So instead of leaving it behind we thought it would be better if we shared our love and experience of the house of our dreams with other people. All that led us to turn it to a small business of our own while making other people feel the warmth and love that this house has given us.\nAfter some years of experience I felt that this is something that I would like to do as an actual job so I began designing other houses and villas for rent in order to share my excitement of what I do and also help other people make a business out of their beautiful homes. \nI will love to be your host. In any house you choose to stay… \n",

It far exceeded expectations in that it had so much more to offer than we had anticipated just from the listing. Maria was incredibly helpful and very quick to respond whenever we had a request. The location, the views and the place itself make me want to return as soon as possible. Could not recommend highly enough!",

They've  truly earned the title of  SUPER HOST's.The property itself is truly magical. perfect location the most beautiful view imaginable. The house was immaculate. They were even nice enough to leave a gift basket with food. There was  also food and water in the refrigerator for us.Everything you could possibly need they provided and then some. if you were lucky enough to come across this listing, you should grab it immediately the best experience I've ever had at an Airbnb. I feel very blessed that we were able to find this property. Out of 5  Stars I give this experience 10#bestexperienceever",

I loved that there was so much to do. The kids were never bored. It’s a 5 minute drive to Disneyland. I wouldn’t recommend walking especially with a baby. The extra Amenities is what I appreciated the most. It’s hard traveling with a baby but they had a high chair, extra stroller and walker. The welcome snacks were a great addition and we never ran out of towels and extra linens. Kathy and Trevor were quick to respond when we couldn’t figure out the alarm. Overall, we love the place and would 100% stay here again.",

Like many fellow villa owners in the Bali  Emerald Villas complex, I was not happy with the financial management of my investment, so we have decided  to break away, set up our own management company and go it alone. I want to offer my guests the best accommodations for the best pricing. Quite reasonable, don't you think? I'm running my own show now and appreciate and will reward any return bookings. Thank you.",

The villa is a 2-minute walk to the main road with ample cafes and restaurants. Our favourite was Sala. A 5-10 minute walk to the beach.",

Her duties include making up the rooms, general cleaning in the villa and full laundry service, including ironing. She will also be happy to help you \nwith your local shopping needs and preparation of meals.",
    "access": "The villa may be rented as a 2-BR or 3-BR accommodation. The unused bedroom will \nbe locked off for the duration of the guest's stay. The housekeeper's area \n(washer/dryer, storage, etc.) will be locked off when she goes home for the\nevening. Otherwise you have full run of the villa and all the amenities within.",
    "notes": "We are very proud of our accommodations and will be working hard to make your stay a pleasant one, focusing on winning your return business. We are hopeful you will share your positive experiences with family and friends and your online reviews.\n\nAdditionally we are offering complimentary airport pickup and drop-off services (min. 5 night stay) and will offer our guests a free late check-out as required provided there are no conflicts with incoming guests. \n\nIt should also be noted that the villa owner has invested significantly to upgrade \nthe villa to his high personal standards for his enjoyment when he comes to stay in Bali. Approximately AUD 20K has been spent to completely replace the kitchen cabinetry and the bathroom cabinetry. This of course includes all new appliances in the kitchen and throughout the villa. New living room furniture, with oversized cushions and a 55\" LED TV have also been added for your entertainment and relaxation. Please check out our photos. I'm sure you will agree the upgrades were worth the time and cost, not only for the owner, but also for our future guests. \n\nAmenities... too many to mention, but we will anyways:\n\nYou will feel safe and secure with 24 hr., round the clock, security.\n\nEntertainment wise, there is a 55\" flat screen TV in the living room and a 32\" and 40\" flat screen TV in the two main bedrooms. Indihome TV and Cable TV are provided for your news, movies, sports and serial TV needs.\n\nIn the mood to be pampered... We can provide you with a menu for in-villa personal spa services. Massages, mani/pedi, facials, etc. are now available in the villa for your convenience. These services have been pre-approved by MBO President Ibu Lany; \nNot good enough for her, not good enough for our guests.\n\nThe bathrooms are very spacious and well appointed inclusive of walk-in showers and bathtubs. The two main bedroom bathrooms both have outdoor Bali showers while the master bedroom also features an outdoor terrazzo bathtub. Check out the photos.\n\nWhat else can we do to make your stay more enjoyable. Just ask us. We will consider any requests. After all, we are in the hospitality business... and we want you to come back and stay with us again. \n\nBaby / Toddler Requirements\n\nWe can assist you with any and all requirements to take better care of the safety and comfort of your little ones. Be it a stroller, car seat, high chair, crib, playpen, etc., we can assure you these requirements will be available at the villa prior to your arrival. We can also provide a swimming pool barrier fence, should you require for your peace of mind during your stay with us. (Fees apply, please ask for quotation)\n\nNOTE: This is a brand new listing that has just joined our management team, hence no bookings have been blocked off yet. Christmas holidays and school holidays going \nforward are currently available. First come, first served. Book now to avoid \ndisappointment.",
    "neighborhood": "There is lots to do and see in Sanur, and all within walking distance of the villa. The complex is located just off the main street with a multitude of shops, bars, and restaurants in either direction. It is also a five minute walk to the beach.",
    "transit": "Getting around\n\nWhen you rent directly with us, the owners, we will provide complimentary pick-up from the airport to our villa, and also include a  complimentary drop-off to the airport on your way home for any guests who have booked a minimum 5 night stay. For less than a 5 night stay we will have to charge for an airport pick-up but will provide a complimentary return trip to the airport after concluding your time with us.\n\nSanur is a very safe village to get around in. For starters, bicycle rentals are silly cheap. Sanur is a very bike friendly community as can easily be seen by the number of cyclists on the streets. Motor scooters can be rented for as little as IDR 50,000 per day. Cars, or MPV's, including drivers, are also readily available at very reasonable rates. Metered taxis (Bluebird) and Grab drivers are always close by. Grab provides the best transport value; If you don't have an account, then sign up. Most tour operators will include pick up and drop off to and from the villa as part of their package. Just ask us any specifics and we will answer you ASAP to help you with the planning of your stay.",
    "interaction": "The villa manager is in Bali regularly to ensure that our high expected standards are being maintained. No worries though, He is only a phone call away and stays in  very close contact with his housekeeper. Any concerns you may have can be quickly communicated, considered and addressed.",
    "house_rules": "Sanur is not a wild and crazy party town. If that is what you are looking for, best focus your search in Kuta. Sanur is a more mature, peaceful community. We value our small-town feel here and enjoy the tranquility Sanur has to offer. Sanur residents are respectful of each other's space and loud music or partying into the wee hours will definitely not be tolerated.\n\nSorry, pets are not permitted due to follow-up guests having potential allergy issues.\n\nThis is a strictly \"No Smoking\" villa. Smoking is not even permitted in the open air\nareas of the property so definitely not allowed in the bedrooms / bathrooms as is common in most hotels these days. If you want to smoke, the owner, the manager and fellow guests would appreciate it very much if you did so out in the common area of the complex. Thank you.",

        "comments": "I booked Papagayo House for a quiet weekend away from LA to celebrate my 60th with my husband, daughter and her boyfriend. The house is even better than the listing - what the photos can't convey is the privacy and peacefulness of the yard. I was worried that being so close to the airport there would be noise but it was shockingly quiet. Beds are comfy, we didn't really use the kitchen beyond coffee but it is well stocked. The real star of this property is the backyard - it is gorgeously designed and landscaped. We paid for the pool to be heated and we spent most of our time in/around the pool and it was well worth it. The little cul de sac is in a nice area and close to everything.",

    "summary": "Outside, lie back in loungers by a saltwater pool. Tell stories around a luxurious fire pit. Balance the famous Palm Springs sun with shade produced by mature trees and a tiki hut. Inside, discover uniquely wallpapered rooms with a living area featuring soaring ceilings and a gourmet kitchen with lots of prep space.\n\nA luxurious modern retreat, there is a great contemporary vibe running strongly through the interiors which feature soaring ceilings highlighted by knotty alder beams, rustic doors, reclaimed wide-plank wood flooring, a fully-equipped gourmet kitchen, custom made furnishings, and spa-like marble and stone bathrooms. For those cool desert nights, there is a cozy fireplace in the great room and for those warm days the back of the house is filled with french doors leading to your own private oasis outside.\n\nThe yard consists of a salt-water swimming pool and Egyptian glass tiled spa. There are multiple seating and lounging areas outdoors including dining for 8 under a tiki hut, a shaded outside living room, poolside chaises for 4, and relaxing loungers around a giant stone firepit. All of this is surrounded by breathtaking mountain views & California fan palms.\n\nBeing a bit farther away from the mountain is key to the success of the outdoor spaces in the house; you get almost an extra hour of sunlight (and sunsets) during the day as compared to the homes close to downtown (and those huge mountains)!\n\nThe bedrooms have televisions with a full cable package, as does the great room. Each room has a ceiling fan and luxurious Egyptian cotton linens. The smaller bedroom has two twin beds, and all rooms have large closets. There is an elegant and modern round dining table that seats 8 for interior dining or game night. The breakfast bar in the kitchen seats 4 atop the striking quartz countertops and glass backsplash, and there is a high capacity washer and dryer just off the side entrance in the garage.\n\nThe attention to detail in this home is like no other available on the vacation rental market in Palm Springs; you will never stay anywhere else after a night in this spectacular space.\n\nPapagayo House is a City of Palm Springs Registered Vacation Rental CITY ID # 3600 TOT PERMIT # PS 6746\n\nThe house is on a quiet cul-de-sac in Palm Springs with amazing views. It's one of the few neighborhoods in the city with buried power lines, so views are unobstructed. Papagayo House is a City of Palm Springs Vacation Rental, #3600\n\nParticipate locally: If you arrive by Thursday, the Palm Springs' downtown area 'Village Fest' on Palm Canyon Drive is transformed into a bustling street fair...Artists, craftsmen, food vendors, musicians and entertainers are there to entertain. Stock up on local farm veggies/fruit or enjoy some great people watching. \n\nAlso experience, on Friday from 4pm to 9pm, 'First Friday On North Palm Canyon' (every month, year-round), between Tachevah and Amado Road, featuring entertainment, food and fun, where more than 50 antique furnishings and art stores remain open into the late evening.\n\nPlease be aware that there are exterior security cameras at the property. They run 24/7 but are not monitored unless an issue arises.

The space was clean and very spacious ( it’s bigger than the photos seem to show!) the outdoor patio with the view is HEAVEN! I will suggest bringing a sound machine if you are a light sleeper. People can be pretty loud going up and down the stairs late at night. But the sound machine next to the window drowned all the noise out! We felt safe and really enjoyed our stay. We will be back again soon! I would also recommend to the host to add an additional tower fan, we bought one for our stay as we were a bit warm and it helped tremendously. The two fans may be enough for many but our family runs hot so we can never have too many fans!",

It is literally a 8 minute walk to the train station, which was amazing, as we had a number of day trips planned elsewhere. The apartment itself was clean, with shampoo and conditioner as well as body wash provided. They were one of the few Airbnb’s that even provided laundry detergent. They left toys because we had a little one, which we and she appreciated. The bed was very comfortable and the apartment felt like home. The washer worked great, but I ended up taking Daniel’s suggestion of just drying the clothes on the rack, which was very efficient given the heat in Seville. Daniel was proactive and asked if we needed the crib, without us even asking for it. We didn’t because our little one is too scared to sleep anywhere when we travel, but the thought was much appreciated. Overall, this place was amazing value. Also, the internet was Lightning speed :) thank you for having us!",

The host was very responsive, very flexible with our weird flight times, and had a very informative binder with details and local places to check out. The sound machine was amazing, but besides a couple \"pedal taverns\" passing by, it was a pretty quiet location. Far enough to not hear the noise of Broadway, but close enough to walk. Depending on which part of Broadway you are heading to, it's about a 7-10 minute walk. Ubers were easy to get for further away places like 12 South and Midtown, and the concierge service for checking our baggage before our flight was AMAZING. The bed was AMAZING, so huge and so comfortable. Perfect spot for coming home and taking a nap before the evening festivities. Kitchen was equipped with everything we needed and everything looked exactly like the photos. Girls, there is plenty of room to get ready in the bathroom and a full length mirror! :)",

It is perfectly located just down the road from the famous Mirador with stunning views of the water and cliffs. It's also very close to another overlook with amazing sunsets and a trail that you can hike down to a secluded sandy beach (it's a commitment, however, to hike back up! but worth it). You definitely need a car (or a bike) to get around as there are no supermarkets, etc nearby. The villa itself is nice, tastefully decorated, with a well stocked kitchen. We had a bit of a problem finding it at first as we arrived after dark but the host was kind enough to leave the key and we were able to get in without a problem. The only issue we had was a bit of a musty/sewage smell in the bathroom and back hallway but the host was very responsive and came the next morning to address it. Unfortunately it was tool chilly to enjoy the pool :(",

Quick drive to many attractions.    Place was clean and had everything you need for meals at home if you want to stay in.  As in the description the place is along a busy road so there was a road noise but they had a noise machine which I think helped. It was not any different than being at a hotel on a busy road.  Pool was great! We would stay here again.",

We weren’t bothered by street noise at all but we appreciated the thoughtful note about ear plugs and the white noise machine.  The bed was soft and comfy.  Kitchen was AWESOME.  We might suggest bringing your own creamer but literally everything else was there.  The place is a short drive from lookout mountain and an even shorter driver from all the events downtown, but our favorite thing was walking to the river and along the river walk.  Parkway poorhouse across the street has great sandwiches and Scottie’s on the over right down the road is excellent overall.  We had a blast and hope to come back again.  Thanks so much!\n\nPS- thanks especially for having beach towels for the pool!!!",

We have always dreamed of being able to host our own place and are now happy to finally be able to do that. We are both long time Nashville residents and are happy to call this place home. Traveling is one of our great passions and we hope to be able to facilitate a glimpse into our way of life as so many others have done for us in our own travels. We also love kayaking and exploring outdoors. Being near water is something we can’t live without for very long which is what drew us to our beautiful condos on the river. Music and art are also great passions as we both play instruments and write music and poetry. As hosts we will do everything in our power to make sure your stay is as enjoyable as possible, so feel free to contact us with any questions you may have. We would love to have you as our guests!",

    "house_rules": "We want for you to have an incredible time, but there are a few rules we would be especially thankful to you for following:\n\nKeep in mind that this is a residential community.  This unit is also on the third floor, which means the downstairs neighbors can hear every move.  So please be considerate and keep the noise level to a minimum. Quiet hours are from 10 pm to 8 am.\n\nIf you'd like to spend time outside at night try to keep it on the balcony and away from the parking area. The sounds carry a bit louder in the parking area, and many bedroom windows are facing this direction. We want to be considerate and make sure we don't disrupt anyone's sleep.\n\nIf you're going to be leaving the condo for a while we would appreciate it if you could turn off all lights, and keep the air around 75 or degrees or higher in the summer, and 70 degrees or lower in the winter. Electricity bills can add up very quickly. \n\nNo smoking inside the condo- A $300 fine will be charged if condo is smoked in. However, you can smoke on the back porch. There will be a designated jar for your cigarette butts out there as well. \n\nNo glass or smoking in the pool area- can get a pretty steep fine for that \n\n\nDo have fun and enjoy all the great things Nashville and this complex have to offer!",

We plan to stay here every time we come to LA (provided the spot is available) it really was that good! it's not just that everything was clean; it's the little things you don't expect, like complimentary wine or a personalized greeting board for your stay. Michael & Laura really made this an unforgettable vacation for us. Thank you so much!",

    "summary": "Tucked away in a peaceful setting with lush landscaping is an oasis away from the hustle and bustle of LA. The Contemporary Cottage has the charm of a country cottage on the outside, with a fresh, contemporary design on the inside with a full kitchen. Or, fire up the patio grill and have a barbecue in a shady garden overlooking your private pool. \nOPTION: $50 to heat the pool, plus $50 per day to keep the pool heated during your stay, with a 2-day minimum.",
    "space": "Private Guesthouse with separate entrance, and your own washer-dryer!\n\nThe Cottage has a living room with high ceilings and a fireplace, as well as a separate full kitchen, bedroom and bathroom.  It is furnished for your comfort, including a high-end sofa bed, a 40” TV in the living room with cable, and an additional TV in the bedroom that both offers \"Netflix\" and \"Pandora\".  We also offer free wireless Internet. Plus, there are indoor and outdoor dining areas, with access to a grill.\n\nThe Cottage can easily fit four people between the queen bed in the bedroom and the very comfortable full size sofa bed in the living room with a memory foam mattress.\n\nThe French doors in the living room open out to a brick patio under the shade of a majestic carrotwood tree, lovely landscaping and a tranquil pool for your enjoyment.",
    "access": "Unrestricted street parking is always available in front of the house, and you have a private side gate entrance secured by a keyless code lock, as well as the Cottage entrance that also has a keypad.",
    "notes": "This alluring cottage is tucked away in the back of a historic property built in 1936, and has some Hollywood history attached to it.  The original owners were famous movie stars named Joan Blondell and Dick Powell.  At the height of their career, they bought this Sherman Oaks property (ranchette, at the time), and would drive over the hill to their \"country home\" that originally included horse stables and a chicken coup.  This special home has had only four owners in over 85 years.  The screenplays for \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" and \"Doc Hollywood\" were written in the Cottage by the previous owner. The current owners are the Palazzolo Family who has happily lived here in the main house for the past 29 years.",
    "neighborhood": "The Cottage is in the quiet, residential neighborhood of Sherman Oaks, which is also home to many celebrities. Unrestricted street parking is always available. It's centrally located to all the LA attractions including Universal Studios, Griffith Park, the Observatory, the LA Zoo, and numerous world-class Museums. Wonderful hiking trails are nearby.  Plus, Hollywood is only 15 minutes away. Santa Monica, Venice, and the beaches are about a 45-minute drive.  Disneyland is less than an hour!",
    "transit": "If you don't have a vehicle, it's a short walk from the Cottage to a high-speed bus that connects to the LA metro system. LAX Airport is about 20 miles away, and you can reach the Cottage via cab, ride-sharing services, or car rental. Since L.A. is so spread out, we do recommend renting a car so you can maximize your time here.",
    "interaction": "Your hosts, Michael and Laura Palazzolo,  live in the main house, and are happy to help make your visit to Los Angeles very memorable! Laura often travels as a Director for the HGTV series \"House Hunters\", but Michael will be your main point of contact and is always a call or text away if you need anything!",
    "house_rules": "Please respect our rules:\nPlease note that parents must agree to be with their children at all times on the property, including the pool.\nAll guests must also sign a release of liability that we will send out via personal email after the booking.\nMaximum of 4 guests\nNo other guests, unless they are approved by the hosts in advance of their arrival.\nNo Pets, No Smoking, No Parties",

It is located in a secure community.\nHis kitchen was well stocked and appointed and we immediately felt at home enjoying lunch  poolside and dinner inside.  Surrounded by beautiful trees and gardens we were able to relax after a busy few days in Cape Town. It was the perfect choice to enjoy some rest and relaxation while exploring  local vineyards and wandering through the art galleries in Franschhoek.\nIzak was responsive with all communication and helpful with any questions.\nIt would be wonderful to return one day.",

Joe et Françoise sont hyper accessibles, attentifs à notre bien être et flexibles. La maison est bien située non loin de la plage, et près du centre. Nous recommandons vivement Plantation House!!",

Our flight was cancelled at the last minute and we had to rebook on a different airline. Françoise was so very quick to respond and help us set up a new airport transfer, and this was on Christmas Eve! The apartment is gorgeous and charming and comfortable, lots of cute little touches. You have everything you need for easy meals and cocktails, and a nice breeze on the porch to relax with your drink. The apartment is close to everything but also feels secluded and private. The apartment has many large windows with shutters to let in the breeze. Françoise and Joe provide beach towels and there are a few chairs in the courtyard, also a little hose to clean all the sand off your feet. The courtyard is lovely and the pool is very refreshing. Don’t miss El Gobernador across the street, their ceviche tostada was the best in town!",

The house is within walking distance to a lovely local winery and the Alella town center, as well as a short drive from the beach. It was also quick to reach the center of Barcelona. \n\nCarine went above and beyond as our host. She was responsive to any issues and gave great suggestions for restaurants.

    "summary": "Escape to Can Rovira, a magnificent 19th century property set on 3 hectares of land, just 3 km from the beach and 20 km from Barcelona. Enjoy the serene surroundings of the Mediterranean garden, take a dip in the pool, and soak up the Spanish sun. This vacation home offers 7 tastefully decorated bedrooms and ample living space, accommodating up to 14 guests. Come experience tranquility and convenience at its finest.",
    "space": "• A bit of history:\n\nIn 1863, our family acquired \"Mas Monnar\", the original house located on the estate. The property was primarily devoted to agricultural activity, particularly the cultivation of grapes and wine production. In its cellars, wines were bottled under the brand \"Alella can Rovira\" and their red wine won the gold medal at the Universal Exposition in Barcelona in 1888. The property has remained in the family ever since.\n\n• The house:\n\nThe house boasts a grand entrance and staircase leading to the first floor, where you'll find a spacious living room, a library that opens out onto the garden, a large dining room, a fully equipped kitchen, three bedrooms, and a bathroom. Moving up to the second floor, you'll find four well-appointed bedrooms, some with sea views, a large living and dining room area and a bathroom. All of our rooms feature carefully designed interiors that aim to preserve the historical value and character of the house.\n\n• The garden and pool:\n\nThe property that surrounds the house spans an impressive 7.4 acres (30000m2) and offers an abundance of outdoor amenities. At the back of the house, a spacious terrace and garden awaits, complete with a BBQ and outdoor dining furniture. Additionally, a swimming pool is available for those who want to take a refreshing dip or simply bask in the sun. The pool is furnished with comfortable loungers and sunshades, and towels are provided for guests' convenience.",
    "access": "Our guests will have access to a private terrace and its garden, the living-rooms and dining-rooms, the equipped kitchen, all the bedrooms (if necessary), the two bathrooms and a sunny terrace to dry their laundry.\nGuests also have the swimming-pool and its private toilet and surrounding garden at their exclusive disposal.",
    "notes": "We will prepare the number of bedrooms and beds based on the number of guests and their preferences. Precise information regarding this will be requested prior to their stay.",

The breathtaking countryside surrounding Alella offers a plethora of outdoor activities, from hiking and cycling to horseback riding and birdwatching.\n\nOne of Alella's most famous treasures, however, lies in its vineyards.

Visitors can indulge in wine tastings and tours, immersing themselves in the art and science of winemaking.",

The villa lived up to the photos; everything was clean and in pristine condition. On the occasions when a minor issue arose, the team was prompt in taking care of it. This extended to my wife's health; when she came down with an ear infection, the front desk was able to arrange for us to receive a house call from a local doctor who immediately provided my wife with antibiotics and pain killers for a very reasonable price -- the front desk and the doctor really saved the day. \n\nThe villa is in a sort of gated community, so it feels quiet, secluded, and safe. The shuttles and taxis arranged by the front desk were very helpful and arrived quickly upon request. The pool was a pleasant temperature. We found the air conditioning to be VERY powerful and hard to moderate, so bring pajamas! (Or turn it off and open the windows.)",

      "about": "Living is knowing how to choose! And traveling is the best choice in life. I believe that life should be lived without scripts where happiness resides in knowing how to live each moment no matter how insignificant it may seem, because each moment is unique and special. I believe we should live by doing what makes us happy, and that we are artists in life by transforming the ordinary into the extraordinary. I believe that dreams should always be pursued, and that you should love madly starting with yourself. Life is an adventure that you should never stop exploring. I believe that discovering the magic of the extraordinary begins with the simple things and with yourself, by taking time to explore a small shop, discover a new song, try a new recipe or simply lose yourself in a book. I think that retro is current, that design is much more than an aesthetic issue, crafts should be a representation of experiences, and you should always bet on the natural versus the artificial.",

Daniel the guard that works the morning is very informative and kind. Their's also a pharmacy that's open late on the first floor. Our first evening here we tried to walk to the center which would have been like a 15 min walk and we kept getting dirty looks from the locals so we turned back and got a taxi. Also the first taxi I took told us he didn't accept U.S dollar and we didn't have pesos yet so he offered we pay in debit or credit so I did, the charge was $7 U.S which is like $100 pesos. Well surprise in the morning after our  first night in Tulum , I woke up $525.30 U.S stolen from my account because of the taxi.\nOnly issues we had with this Airbnb we're the ants in the ac and bathroom and loud sounds from the kitchen  sink. \nBeware of thieving taxis!",

That being said it’s a great stay with good food within walking distance. Place does need maintenance, but overall a good deal and a good home base for touring Tulum",

  "description": {
    "summary": "Lie back on pillows to watch sunset over the Tulum jungle through a wide, balconied glass facade. Cool off on a communal rooftop with a Balinese bed and infinity pool. Clean-lined design features natural materials and handmade local furniture. Fast fiber optic Wifi (30 Mbps) for fun and stable remote working. The 2nd floor apartment is located only 5 minutes from the town center and 10 minutes by taxi or bike from the spectacular beaches of the Caribbean.",
    "space": "This studio is located in-between Tulum town and the beach, an architectural concept that combines contemporaneous design with local culture. The studio features a very clean design and a wide glass facade with balconies facing the jungle. It offers a lot of fresh air, natural light and incredible sunset views from the bed. The space is equipped and furnished to offer everything you need to spend a comfortable stay in Tulum:\n\n• A comfortable queen size bed and an extra sofa bed, casual dining area for 4 people with fully equipped kitchenette including high-end appliances such as fridge, microwave, coffee maker, all necessary kitchen utensils, clean and modern bathroom, hair dryer, towels for beach and bath, shampoo and shower gels, wardrobe with hangers, iron, fast WIFI, smart TV hooked up to watch Youtube, Netflix and more, A/C, tower washer and dryer (located in a separate public room and shared with a few other condos). Also, the tab water is safe to drink thanks to a special purification treatment (side note: be aware that drinking tap water is safe at this studio, but not elsewhere in Tulum).\n\n• Spectacular shared infinity swimming pool on the roof top terrace with panoramic view. The perfect setting to enjoy the most amazing Tulum sunsets and sunrises. There is a BBQ grill on the common terrace as well which is available to be taken advantage of at any time.\n\n• The 24/7 secured condo building is located in a quiet and safe area surrounded by vast jungle.\n\n• It is only 5 minutes to town with plenty of trendy taco places and restaurants like Burrito Amor, El Camello Jr, Humo, La Hoja Verde, La Bonita, etc, and many cool bars and clubs like Amapola, or Batey Mojito Bar.\n\n• The beach is only 10 minutes away and you can get there by bike, taxi or drive your own (rental) car. Relax at one of the many public beaches like Las Palmas or Paraiso, or hang out and enjoy one of the many beautiful beach clubs like Papaya Playa Project, Coco Tulum, Boa, La Zebra, Casa Malca, Akiin, etc. (check also if there is a full moon party at Papaya Playa Project while you are in Tulum, it's worth it!).\n\n• The Mayan ruins of Tulum are located on the other side of the village about 10 minutes from the condo, a must-do. The tall pyramid of Coba is a little bit further inlands but yet not more than 25 minutes driving from the condo.\n\n• Not to forget, visit at least one of the amazing cenotes (natural water pools) that connect with one of the biggest underground river systems in the world. Visit at least one of them while in Tulum like for example Cenote Cristal and Escondido, Calavera, Gran Cenote, Dos Ojos and Nicte Ha, Casa Maya, etc. Most of the cenotes are just a 10 to 15 minute bike ride away and definitely worth the trip.\n\nThe space is a concept inspired by love and art, making it a truly unique and Tulum experience, just the perfect home away from home in this magical destination.",
    "access": "The studio is 100% private and no one else other than you has access except the cleaning staff (with prior approval from you). You have also access to the property's large common roof top terrace and infinity pool with panoramic view (enjoy the most amazing sunsets in Tulum), lounge chairs and sun beds, balinese bed, showers, BBQ grill, picnic table, washing sink, public bathrooms, as well as a beautiful patio.",
    "notes": "The studio is made of local high quality finishes (Chukum) and locally handmade furniture combined with state-of-the-art technology appliances, fast and stable fiber optic Wifi (30 Mbps), a smart TV hooked up with major online streaming platforms (no cable TV), microwave and other amenities. The Chukum finish is an ancient Mayan material for walls and floors that allows the space to breathe and to keep the studio fresh and in harmony with nature. If you travel with your little one, I am happy to provide a baby crib for your stay without any cost. By the way, the building is 100% electric (all facilities and installations) so there is absolutely NO GAS or monoxide anywhere at all.",
    "neighborhood": "The studio is located on Kukulkan Avenue (the new direct route to the beach), between Colonia La Veleta and Aldea Zama, the best residential areas in Tulum. Only 2 kilometers from the beach, 2 kilometers from the most beautiful Cenotes, and about 500 meters from restaurants and shops.\n\nIt is possible to walk to the city center of Tulum (about 10 minutes), go by bicycle (about 5 minutes) or drive. The taxi fare from the ADO bus terminal is approximately $40 pesos.\n\nGreat local atmosphere thanks to a great mix of locals, long and short term visitors from all around the world. Close to the city center but far enough to sleep peacefully at night.",
    "transit": "The natural way to get around in Tulum is by bicycle. It is a convenient way to get around the city and to the Cenotes and the beach. If you want to rent bikes for your stay, there is a nearby bike rental shop called Kelly Bike Rental Tulum where you can rent for only $100 pesos per day per bike (based on availability).\n\nTaxis are another easy and cheap way to get around and I am happy to provide you with the mobile phone numbers of reliable taxi drivers or help you ordering when needed. The taxi fares vary based on the city sections, but are somewhere between $40 and $240 pesos.\n\nAnother option is renting a car. There are all major car rental companies at Cancun Airport as well as in Tulum. My personal recommendation is Hertz but there are many other car rental options available.",
    "interaction": "My goal is to ensure a flawless and comfortable stay for you. Whatever the motive of your visit is, contact us through Airbnb at any time, my team and I are happy to help with recommendations, inspiration or anything else you need. We are available on Airbnb 24/7 all year round.",

Location is perfect with restaurants, shops and museums all in walking distance. The pizza right in front of the home and the ice cream shop right next to the home is a must! The home is very safe and police officers are stationed right in front of the home. The police officers and the community are amazing. We had a small issue with our son whom is autistic and it was incredible to see how they all came together to help us! This is a rare find in the area. We are Dominican and did a thorough search before booking. We will definitely be going back!\n\nThings to keep in mind:\n-Having cash will come in handy as Leslie and Annie will cook breakfast, lunch or dinner at a fee ($35 each meal when we were there)\n-If you break a cup, it will cost you $6 which you pay the ladies before their shift change",

The staff is excellent too, Leslie and Annie are great, from making breakfasts or dinners to attending to any request we had. They are always happy to help. Also the transportation provided by Huander was perfect. Always helpful with good recommendations and safety is A+. I traveled there with my family and we had an great time. We do travel a lot in the US, Europe and the Caribbean and stay in homes trough different platforms and own vacation rental properties ourselves and  I have to say that we were really satisfied with Casa Panteon. I can recommend this property and would love to stay here again. \n\nGabriel Montero",

From the best location to the size of the house, cleanliness, amenities,friendliness and com. The house is really big and allows comfort for large families and groups. The open air pool area was remarkable and inviting. As great, spectacular and comfortable as the house was there was on factor that made it beyond good to excellent! That was the housekeeper Leslie!! She was very attentive, warm , friendly and accommodating. I’ve stayed in 5 star plus hotels and her attention to service is unparalleled. Thank you Leslie for making our stay from great to excellent! This will be my new home on return visits! Well Done Piero!",

Cama gostosa, bons travesseiros, roupa de cama e toalhas muito boas. \nBom chuveiro também. \n\nNão usei nada de cozinha, mas é bem equipada. \n\nO único ponto é que para quem tem dificuldade de dormir pode ser um pouco barulhento, então recomendo levar tampão de ouvido para os mais sensíveis ;) com as janelas todas fechadas, no entanto, ameniza bastante.",

I love the stunning scenery, food, wine and lifestyle that this vibrant city offers and would love to share this with you.\r\nMy goal is to make my guests feel they are in their own “home away from home” when staying in my apartment.

Prepare breakfast in a modern, well-equipped kitchen. Freshen up in spacious, luxurious bathroom with walk-in shower and soaking tub.  Relax on the comfy leather sofa and enjoy your favorite Netflix series. Drift away in a sumptuous king-size bed with a gentle breeze from the ceiling fan.\n\nSmart TV with sound bar and access to DSTV plus all the main steaming services, including Netflix, Brit Box, Showmax, Apple TV and YouTube.\n\nThe apartment has Air Conditioning, super fast uncapped Fibre Wifi and DSTV satellite TV.  A fully equipped kitchen with Nespresso coffee machine.  Bedroom with king size bed, ceiling fan, en-suite bathroom with bath and large walk in shower.  There is a safe in the bedroom.\n\nThe living area has sliding doors and a balcony from which you have a stunning view to watch the ships sail in and out of the harbour.  \n\nThere is one secure parking bay within the building.\n\nFull access to the large well equipped gym as well as the swimming pool and sun deck.\n\nConferencing facilities, meeting rooms and daily office space are available upon request.\n\nThe MyCiti bus stop is just outside the Icon building.\n\nIt will be my pleasure to assist you in anyway I can whilst you stay in our city.  I'm a full time Airbnb host so am always available to help out.\n\nThis apartment is perfectly located for exploring the city. It's a gentle 15-minute stroll to the waterfront, and is at the start of the famous Long Street, which is known for its fine restaurants and bars. The tourist buses and local buses stop right outside the building making getting around a breeze.  The Cape Town International Convention Center is but a stone throw away.  For exploring wider a field the location is ideal given the close proximity to the main highways in and out of the city.\n\nThe two main highways in and out of the city (N1 and N2) are right on your doorstep should you be exploring further afield.\n\nFresh milk and water will be in the fridge when you arrive along with a selection of teas and coffee.

There was a power outage for a few hours at the end of our stay, but the host was proactive and checked in on us.\n\n2 cons were the broken fence around the property and inconvenient location. 1) We expected the yard to be fully fenced from the description, but there were parts of the wire fence that need to be fixed, so we weren’t able to let our dogs free without a leash. Bummer bc it was one of the main reasons we booked this house. 2) The location is a bit remote. The closest place to get decent food in the area is the town diner, which is a 15 min drive down a very windy road. The busier areas with more food options are at least 30 min drive away. We researched this ahead of time, but the drive feels much longer on the mountainous/rural roads.\n\nIf you’re looking for a more remote getaway, this is great, but we ended up feeling a bit too removed from the fun stuff.",

We loved watching the birds and the deer families walk across the yard. The beds and linens were soft and comfy. There isn’t a lot of places to put your clothes, so if you are an over packer like me, you’ll have to live out of your suitcase, but it was no big deal, just thought it was something to note. I was a little nervous that the window ac units weren’t going to cool the house, but I was so wrong, with the fans going it actually got quite chilly in there. We had great weather and some awesome thunderstorms that we got to watch from bed in the loft, on clear nights you could also see the Big Dipper! The pool and backyard are definitely the star of the show! Our dog loved exploring the fenced in backyard! The landscaping and trees are so beautiful leading down to the pool. We had the best time by the pool, which is huge and sparkling clean!",

The weather was iffy when we were there but did not pose a problem because the kitchen was well equipped and the cozy furniture was perfect for hanging out. When the weather was cooperative we enjoyed spending time at the pool which was sparkling clean with very good lounge chairs. I'd recommend doing a little research before you go so that you have a list of places you'd like to visit since cell reception once you leave the property is not reliable. Best to have a screenshot of your itinerary and some printed materials so you don't miss some of the good stuff, especially the walks! \nWe did not eat dinner out but did have lunch in Kerhonkson at the Kerhonkson Diner and outside Kingston at Hickory's BBQ. Both very good! \nBest of all,  Lily was incredibly responsive and kind and really cared that we had a great experience in her home.",

Being by the poolside with a cocktail in my hand is my kind of vacation. I am a mother to two wonderful boys and live in the fast-pace city of Los Angeles so coming to the desert is my happy place. I particularly love this place, due to it's privacy, quietness, and serene lush views of the mountains.  I hope you enjoy our home as much as we do! \r\n\r\n",

For the last 12 years, I had a life on the road working for a production company that sent me on cruise ships to assist with the productions onboard.  An interesting experience to say the least!!  I'm someday hoping to get back to Australia and spend some more time in the interior.  Also, looking forward to returning to that small ski town in Germany named Garmmisch...what a neat little hideaway.  \r\nOh, and I have rental properties myself, so I understand the importance of leaving someones home in good condition :) Just saying....",

We really enjoyed having the pool/spa in the courtyard for privacy and the backyard had beautiful mountain and golf course views. Experienced  excellent communication with the host too, always quick and helpful replies. It was clear that our host really cared about making our stay enjoyable. For example, the living room TV stopped working and they were quick to get it fixed, having a new one installed that same day! We were impressed with the house and host. We highly recommend this house and definitely plan to stay there again.",
