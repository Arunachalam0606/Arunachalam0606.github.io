Worked as a carpenter and then a contractor for the next eight years, while the itch to move back grew stronger. \r\nFound a lovely lady from PEI and convinced her to marry me. Married up a few levels. Had two super-daughters and decided it was time to move back to The Island. Found a perfect little chunk and did everything we could to make it our own. \r\nAnd here we are.

We loved meeting the dogs and cats of the farm too! The hot tub and outdoor shower were both very clean and the water was the perfect temperature! Inside the shipping container is very cozy and just enough room. It had everything we needed for our 4 day stay! We loved it, and hope to visit again!",

      "about": "Hi! We are a family that has many passions, but a few of the ones that make us come alive the most are relationships, designing and hospitality, so this is a dream come true for us. We love nature, so we'll often be outside hiking, camping  or relaxing on our front porch. We love cooking, reading, making wood fired pizzas, traveling and learning. We have all personality types in our family, so there is never a dull moment!  When we travel we love finding unique airbnb places to stay. No boring hotel rooms for us! A few of our favorite destinations are Tulumn, Mexico, New River Gorge, West Virginia, The Highway 1 on the California coast. There's nothing like cruising down the highway in a convertible, with the fresh, piney smell of the Redwoods , and the wild crashing of the ocean and the moisture of the ocean in the air! We love life, and God has richly blessed us with one that is rich in experience, and we want to pass it on to you while you stay in our little corner of the world.",

Yes, there are stairs to get down to the building so we suggest you try to pack enough for only one trip down. Some of the other reviews discussed that you can see the other building from your building; however, there is a privacy net/door and during the 4 day stay we did not once see or hear the other guests. The place looked exactly like the pictures, we enjoyed the new experience of outside showering (there is also an inside one for people who wouldn’t like that), along with cooking s’mores and hotdogs over the fire. The lookout deck is gorgeous for viewing the sunset. If you’re someone who is looking for a place to stay to get away from society, this is the place you’re looking for. There is also a great bistro down the road called Rebecca’s Bistro that serves awesome gluten free options (my boyfriend is celiac). We will continue to recommend this air bnb to others, it’s a must stay!",

It is definitely a camping trip vibe for those that may be iffy  with bugs. We do not mind this though, just wanted others to be aware if they are iffy with bugs :)",

We let the host know and their admin responded within minutes. \nThe overall location of the property is great as it’s close to a couple good restaurants and breweries as well as Lake Logan, and it’s an easy drive to many of the hiking locations.  \nWe would definitely consider the Boho Box Hop when returning to the Hocking Hills area.",

Thoughtfulness in checking on me when a storm rolled in. The place itself is even better than pictures. It was my first tiny house experience and I enjoyed my stay. The house was more than comfortable and had all the necessary amenities. The windows throughout the house provided so much natural elements surrounded by trees which brought such a blissful relaxing setting, escaping the busy life. A short walk to find a creek was a peaceful spot to hang out on the property. Highly recommend staying at Rachel’s tiny haven house and appreciate the hospitality. Enjoyed the small town setting nearby with local food, coffee and small shops.",

    "summary": "Exclusive tiny home experience on 100 acres with outdoor spaces, hiking trails, and creek access. Enjoy solitude in nature for a girls' weekend, couple's getaway, or a fun family trip. Curl up with a good book on the comfy couch in the modern, cabinesque-style tiny home, or take a walk and clear your mind while enjoying the scenic creek and hiking trails.",
    "space": "Enjoy our modern, beautiful tiny home nestled in nature with giant windows, a full kitchen, comfortable beds, and incredible outdoor spaces. There are hiking trails, a lawn for outdoor fun, and a private, romantic string-lit fire pit.\n\nInside the Tiny Home\nJust because you're staying in a tiny home does not mean you have to compromise on comfort! The spacious 275 sq. ft. tiny home offers cozy lofts with memory foam beds, A/C, heating, a full kitchen and bathroom, a desk, and a comfy couch. We now have Wi-Fi! The couch may be used as a pull-out couch. Please bring extra pillows and linens if you plan to use the couch, as these are not provided.\n\nThe Off-Grid Toilet\nThe bathroom features an off-grid, composting toilet with a cartridge. It is easy to use and we provide instructions! Please note: you will need to dump out your own liquid waste!\n\nThe Property\nThe tiny home is privately nestled on 100 acres. There are other Airbnbs on the property, but they are out of sight. The only time you’d see others is on the road or trails. There are trails for your use. It is common to see wildlife such as deer, turkeys, rabbits, butterflies and more! There is also a creek that runs along the entire property, making for a fun wading spot or beautiful photos! We have an outdoor fire pit area that comes complete with skewers, a grill cover, and firewood. A picnic table is also right outside the tiny home for your use. Last but not least, there is a lawn area that is perfect for a picnic or kicking around a soccer ball. (Note: When booking your stay, you agree that you have read, understand, and agree to the Liability Waiver at the end of the listing description.)\n\nThis listing includes:\n- All linens and pillows for both beds (king and twin).\n- Hammock that you can hang anywhere.\n- Outdoor dining and lounging furniture with a fire pit. One bundle of firewood is included*.\n- A living area with a couch and a Bluetooth speaker.\n- A modern, stainless-steel kitchen that includes a full sink, gas stove and oven, and a full fridge. I have basic cooking utensils, pots and pans, and basic cooking supplies. There is also a coffee pour over, kettle, local coffee grounds and coffee filters for your use. I have all basic silverware and dishes too.\n- A full bathroom with a stand-up shower, towels, and a composting toilet. Toilet paper, shampoo, conditioner, and body wash are all included.\n\n*You can purchase more bundles of firewood for $8/each. One bundle is 8 pieces. Please arrange this with me ahead of time. \n\nAbout 20 minutes away from the home is High Falls State Park, which is a very fun place to go with hiking, a giant waterfall, kayaking, canoeing, etc. Admission is only $5 and is definitely worth the trip!\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS: \nQ: Will I have phone service?\nA: I cannot guarantee that you will have service. Most people always have talk/text with some data. I know that Verizon doesn’t have great service. AT&T and Sprint seem to have the best.\n\nQ: Is there Wi-Fi?\nA: Yes, there is!\n\nQ: Is the place fully cleaned between guests? \nA: Heath, safety, and well-being of our guests are of utmost importance to us. For this reason, we use a thorough and extensive process of cleaning the tiny home after each check-out.\n\nQ: Can I bring my dog?\nA: Dogs under 80 lbs are welcome for a $30 pet fee. Please ensure they are included in your reservation.",
    "access": "Make yourself at home (you know: within reason). A lockbox on the outside of the house is where your keys will be, so you can have them with you for effortless coming-and-going.",
    "notes": "Notes\n- Two guests are included in the original listing price. Any guests after that are $20 each (ages 4 and up).\n\n- The road you take to get to our property can be mildly busy and road noise can be heard when you're outside.\n\n- When you first arrive on the property, you will pull into a church's parking lot.  There is a dirt road that you will take to access the tiny house.\n\n- The house requires some degree of self-reliance and understanding as it is on 100 acres of private land. Of note: The driveway to the house is not paved the entire way and may leave your car a bit dirty.\n\n- The house is very much immersed in nature. Nature has bugs and animals. You WILL PROBABLY see both. There may even be an ant or similar such bug in the house. I promise it won't hurt you.\n\n- While the house is very isolated and very peaceful, you may hear noise from other Airbnb guests and adjacent properties. It's common to hear the neighbors shooting guns too, but don't worry, they're nowhere close! (The closest neighbor is 500+ yards away, so you're good!)\n\nLIABILITY WAIVER.\nYou understand that hiking and the use of the creek is at your own risk and that special risks may be involved with hiking and creek access. You accept full responsibility for any bodily injury arising from hiking and use of the creek and hold owner harmless. You understand there are potential dangers that hiking and the use of the creek may present to children who are not carefully supervised, as well as the danger to any person hiking or using the creek if a person has health risks, or if a person hikes or uses the creek while intoxicated or using any kind of drugs or medication, or while pregnant. You agree to be fully and solely responsible for any accidents you may incur. You understand the risks discussed above and agree that you will assume all responsibility for yourself and for the consequences of those in your party. You agree to waive any claim whatsoever against owner for accidents or claims arising from hiking or using the creek. All Airbnb Guests in my party acknowledge and agree that they have read and understand this waiver and they acknowledge that booking constitutes a binding and enforceable contract between Airbnb Guests and Airbnb Host.",

The home itself is absolutely adorable and perfect for a romantic getaway for two. The decor is super cute—especially loved the kitchen island made from a bike frame. The shower was hot, the bedding comfy, and my favorite of all: there were ice cubes in the freezer. (Hooray for ice cubes! Thanks!!) If you follow Ryann’s clear instructions about getting up the driveway, you won’t have any problems. (The “mini container” marker was extremely helpful!) I highly recommend Ryann’s home. We hope to stay again! Thanks !!",

Currently managing properties in 13 different states. \n\nI'm a husband and father to 3 incredible little boys. My all time favorite things to do, would have to be golf, exploring a downtown area, or relaxing all day on a beach. I  love brainstorming with like-minded entrepeneurs who are enthusiastic about new opportunities, just like me. I like to make things happen! Which is why I love what I do. \n\nCurrently, I am helping homeowners from across the country manage there AirBNBs and welcome guests into their 2nd homes through BNB Breeze. We are a hands-on short term rental management company and mostly handle Airbnb listings and the logistical work that goes into managing these properties. Showcasing these properties to look their best and bring in higher returns for investors is just a small part of what I do. \n\nI'm excited to say that the company has grown to include many team members! Heather, Aj, and Barb are all working full-time to help BNBbreeze maintain all of the beautiful properties we manage. Additional part-time team members help round out our entire business. Working with with these folks is part of what makes this job so fun:)\n\nI look forward to serving you and making your Airbnb experience one you’ll love and remember for years to come!\n\nLandon",

    "summary": "Have it both ways with the Tiny Bunker - a retreat in nature AND a 5 minute walk to historic downtown Todd or a 15 to 20 min. drive to downtown Boone and W.Jefferson. Enjoy the well appointed Tiny Bunker and two decks, with private access to a hot tub, fire table, dining nook and comfy outdoor furniture. Cook meals in the Bunker's small kitchen or outdoor grilling area. Relax and refresh while experiencing the joy of tiny living!",
    "space": "The Tiny Bunker was designed and built with the vision for simple yet comfortable living that supports a deep connection with nature and a smaller footprint on the planet. The meticulously designed 160 square foot Tiny Bunker makes use of every inch and lacks for nothing.\n\nWith the small interior footprint, the majority of the space is dedicated to two truly magical outdoor areas. The outdoor main deck is equipped with a hot tub, dining area, fire pit, and seating area to relax and enjoy nature in. The second deck brings you even further among the trees, accentuating the winter views of the mountains. Read a good book, take a nap, or enjoy the view of the trees while relaxing on the outdoor patio furniture on the second deck. You can expect to see birds, deer, and other wildlife about while you enjoy the outdoors.\n\nThe Tiny Bunker itself was built with all the essentials and packaged into a cozy, comfortable, and retreat-like space. With an emphasis on sustainability, the Cabin is powered from the nearby community solar garden and guests can reduce waste by recycling and composting on the property. Tall ceilings, well equipped kitchen,  unique high end bathroom, convertible working/dining area, and a comfy sleeping space with cozy sheets are a few of the features. Log in to your video streaming accounts and enjoy a movie while relaxing after a day of exploring. A complete coffee and tea bar, along with luxury shampoos/soaps are just a few of the other amenities provided.",
    "access": "Guests will have complete private access to the whole Tiny Bunker and two decks!",
    "notes": "LOCATION: The Tiny Bunker is located on an approximately 3 acre plot of land with 2 other tiny house rentals that can be booked separately or, depending on availability, can be rented together. We emphasize privacy and have set up each home to maximize guest seclusion and minimize visibility of the properties from each other. We include photos of the view of the other properties in each listing so that guests have a good sense of the visibility/seclusion. Also to note, the Tiny Bunker is located in close proximity to NC 194, a lightly traveled paved road with occasional traffic. Guest should be aware that they will hear the occasional car pass by.\n\nACCESSIBILITY: To reach the Tiny Bunker, you must drive up a 150 winding gravel driveway to your tiny destination. We have never had a guest unable to make it up the driveway, but in the case of a major storm, there is a pullout across the road from the driveway where guests can park and walk up the short driveway.\n\nPARKING: You will have one dedicated parking space for your use during your stay. We may be able to accommodate a second vehicle and ask that you request this from us prior to your arrival. If you will be towing a trailer, you can park it across the street in the large pullout.",
    "neighborhood": "Whatever you’re in the mood for, you will find it nearby. Historic downtown Todd is only a 10-minute drive, where you will find live music in the summer, the famous Todd Mercantile, and locals and tourists hanging out. RiverGirl Fishing Company and the New River are also located in downtown Todd and offer fishing, biking, kayaking, and tubing.  Just a 17-minute drive from the cabin is Elk Knob State Park with miles of hiking, biking, jogging, exploring, and a stunning view at the top. Appalachian Ski Mtn, the Blue Ridge Parkway, ziplining, golfing, hunting, and countless hiking trails are within 30 minutes of the property. Grandfather Mountain, many more hiking trails and countless wineries are within an hour's drive. It really is the best of both worlds with city life and nature readily accessible.",
    "transit": "You can walk to downtown Todd in 5 minutes or less. Highway NC 194 South is famous as a biking road and it takes approximately 1 hour to bike to Boone or Jefferson.",
    "interaction": "Check in is after 3pm and check out is before 11am. If you want to check in earlier or check out later, just let us know in advance and we will try our best to accommodate",
    "house_rules": "Quiet hours after 9pm. Please remove shoes at door.\n\nDO NOT PLACE HOT POTS/PANS directly on wood countertops or tables (this will cause burn damage!!).\n\nABSOLUTELY NO SMOKING inside or near the Bunker. You will be charged a $500 smoke removal fee if any smoke smell is detected.\n\nABSOLUTELY NO PETS! Our insurance policy does not cover pets so we unfortunately have to be strict with our no pet rule. A $100 pet fee will be charged if any pet hairs or other evidence are found inside the property, in addition to any damage fees.",

As hosts, we love providing spaces for couples, friends, and families to connect. \n\nWe first met in Thailand and quickly discovered we shared a love of travel and together have explored over 30 countries. In 2017 we got married and moved to Ohio, where we decided to start hosting travelers who want to experience our little corner of the world. \n\nWe've designed our properties with relationship and connection in mind, and it's our hope that all who stay at one of our properties get to experience the joy of connecting, relaxing, and spending time together. If you're the adventurous sort and want to experience what the area has to offer, we have a guidebook with all of our favorite things to do in Ohio's Amish Country. ",

They mention their love of travel and some special touches do make it feel like a rural European getaway. The Sauna and fire pit area is so cool at night with the lit walkway to the cabin. Everything was super clean and i felt comfortable there quickly.  Would absolutely stay here again and maybe with better weather, take in more of Amish country.",

    "summary": "Most people think of a tiny home as a small, cramped space. Nothing is further than the truth. Intentional design in The Scandi maximizes its small footprint. \n\n12' tall ceilings make the space feel roomy and spacious. Big beautiful windows on all sides give you a sense of being close to nature. Watch your favorite show on the 55\" 4K tv. A skylight and memory foam mattress let you fall asleep under the stars. The outdoor sauna, ice barrel and firepit are all yours to enjoy.  @tinystays_berlin",
    "space": "Think Glamping - not Camping. A luxurious experience awaits you at the Scandi.\n- Full bathroom with hot/cold running water. (No composting toilet) \n- AC/Heat\n- Kitchenette equipped with all the basics. Full fridge/freezer, microwave, hot plate, silverware, pots, pans, etc.\n- Coffee station! Complete with fresh beans from The Red Mug, a burr grinder, and everything you need to make yourself a pour-over (or drip coffee). \n- Solar-powered skylight over the bed lets you fall asleep looking at the stars. \n- Memory foam mattress. \n- Smart-home features. In addition to typical light switches, you'll be able to play music, dim the lights, and more through Alexa. \n\n- A 55-inch 4k TV, with subscriptions to:  Netflix, Amazon Prime, and live TV through Youtube TV.\n- Outdoor firepit area. Firestarter and firewood are provided. \n- Ice Barrel. (Not available in winter months). The firepit area and sauna are exclusively for your use.",
    "access": "You'll be able to let yourself in with the keyless entry code we provide you with your check-in instructions.",
    "notes": "Our other tiny home (The Lux) on the same property. It's set up with a separate parking spot and path, so you'll still have plenty of privacy during your stay. Check it out in our profile!",
    "neighborhood": "The Scandi is tucked back in a wooded area at the back of a small neighborhood. Once you park your car, you'll walk down a path through the woods to get to your personal  Eden. The deck, a firepit area, and an outdoor sauna are exclusively available for your use.\n\nLocated near downtown Berlin - the heart of Amish Country, local restaurants, coffee shops, and retail stores are less than a mile away.",
    "transit": "The Scandi is near the heart of Ohio's rural Amish Country, so bringing your own car is the best way to get around.",
    "interaction": "You'll get access to our guidebook, complete with everything you need to know about staying at The Scandi as well as all of our favorite restaurants and shops in the area. You'll be able to self-check-in with keyless entry, but if you would like to meet us, we would be happy to chat at a local coffee shop!",
    "house_rules": "Absolutely no smoking in the tiny home or on the deck. A $200 fine will be charged if there is any evidence of smoking. \n\nThe Scandi is set up for two people. A $20 per night per person fee will be charged for a third person. \n\nWe understand your pet is part of the family and we are thrilled to have them join you. We ask that you add your pet to the reservation as there is an additional $50 pet fee. We also ask that no pet is left alone in the house unattended unless it is in a cage. Please be sure to clean up after your dog outside.",

The hot tub was nice to have to relax and enjoy on a breezy evening. \n\nThe only thing that was that we weren’t prepared for the dog that was between the 2 gates that we had to open to get in and out. I wish we had been notified that a dog was there. It was a bit shocking at first but then felt like we had to be responsible to not accidentally hit the dog with our car or let it out onto the busy road. \n\nOtherwise the house was great and we would definitely visit again. Thank you!",

We will definitely stay again, when in Orlando!!",

She was also proactive in making sure we had a comfortable stay. The place looked exactly like the pictures (looks even better in person) & is just beautiful overall. Even the beds hanging on the walls were comfortable. I told her I planned to sleep in one ahead of time & she already had the bed down so I didn’t have to struggle while doing it. The space is compact but had everything we needed. It was also close to many activities, restaurants & stores. I’d stay here again in a heart beat. The way she has designed, decorated & been intentional about every detail within the space is admirable. Amazing place. Amazing host.",

Our check in time is at 4pm, so when we have a guest arriving the same day of your check out, we need adequate time to clean and do laundry for the next guest. \n\n•You may not exceed the number of people specified at time of booking. No other than these persons to spend the evening OR VISIT unless prior pre-approval.  House and property not to be used for entertaining. No exceptions, sorry. Any guest beyond the number listed on your itinerary will be charged a $50 penalty fee and we reserve the right to terminate your stay immediately (even in the middle of the night) without refund if you exceed the maximum occupancy AT ANY TIME.\n\n•All guests must be 25 years of age or older unless accompanied by a parent or pre-approved by us.\n\n•No pets, candles or smoking in the home or on property at all! If you are caught sneaking an animal onto the property or smoking on property you will be immediately vacated and charged a $250 extra cleaning fee. \n\n•The Internet may not be used for illegal activity.\n\n•No marijuana (medical or recreational) or vaping on our property.\n\n•Security cameras on the outside of property in use. This is for your protection and ours. \n\n•T.V. only has streaming abilities with your own login, no networks.\n\n•We ask that you respect the fact that our home is in a residential area with working people, families and children, many of whom are our friends, including friends who live next door. Be aware of the city noise ordinance between the hours of 10 PM and 7 AM. If violated, you may be subject to a visit by the police if a complaint is made by neighbors and you may be asked to vacate the property immediately. If you have a problem with any of these rules, this is not the place for you but if these rules are followed, you will immensely enjoy your stay at the “Ship Yard.”",

One of our favorite activities to do as a family is hike. In fact, some of our most cherished memories have stemmed from our hiking adventures, with Hocking Hills topping the list! That was the catalyst that paved the way for our desire to have our own little piece of paradise, which was a brief escape from the hustle and bustle of the everyday demands back home. From there, The Blockhouse was born…\n \nWhether you’re looking for a little peace and quiet to get away from it all, or if you’re looking to blaze the trails and perhaps mingle with the locals, this place offers all that and so much more. It’s a little slice of Heaven, and we sincerely hope you enjoy the experience just as much as we do.",

    "neighborhood": "We are located in the heart of Hocking Hills! Just a short leisurely walk from the cabin, you’ll find our private wooded sanctuary that is truly breathtaking! There are 3 waterfalls, one with a 30-foot drop on the property, along with hemlocks that decorate the entire 20 acres in a beautiful canopy of seclusion. There’s no need to wander off the property to find adventure, for this property offers a labyrinth of trails that will lead you to countless rock formations and spectacular sights. \n\nHowever, even the most ambitious trailblazer will find there is plenty of adventure waiting right around the corner…. all located within 15 minutes of The Blockhouse. We are situated less than 2 miles from Old Man’s Cave and Conkle's Hollow…in fact, you can walk from the wooded lot straight into the state forest!\"",

I love camping, biking, running, playing at the lake, and going on adventures. I can’t cook so I have eaten just about everywhere in Asheville so if you need advice on where to go, I’m pretty hip to what's good. I have been told that Airbnb is my hobby and I have to admit that they are right! I love dreaming up ideas for cabins and spaces. It’s been so fun for me to do and I love getting to see people enjoy the spaces so please share photos with me on Insta gram under Pisgah Highlands. ",

The hosts were very responsive and provided great local recommendations for hikes and restaurants that we utilized. The glass door, record player, and fireplace were our favorite parts!! Highly recommend!",

It cooled off enough at night to sleep comfortably, but got pretty warm and humid during the day, a fan would be great to bring in summer months. The lot is heavily wooded and shady so things stay a bit damp. Loved using the fireplace and the kitchen/sink was very functional, nice that water jugs were there ready to go. The bathroom is an outhouse situation and I will note that it’s right on the deck so if you’re smell-sensitive it might not be the best thing. It was well-maintained but I did smell it a bit with the door closed, but it was summer and humid. The plus side is it’s easy to access in the dark. Overall a good low-key summer getaway, loved laying in bed with the garage door open and screen down while listening to the forest!",

For those going after us - there are two baby nuthatch birds in a nest in the corner of the container near the outdoor fireplace. The parents were quite comfortable sharing our space and it was so fun to watch. \n\nThe ability to open the garage door and keep the bugs out with the net was perfect. If it started to feel warm, we closed the garage door and the AC unit cooled the place down quickly! Everything was as described - however the picture of the toilet is different from the current layout with a variation of a portapotty that’s emptied weekly. The shower situation is doable - just keep your expectations minimal. I don’t think there’s enough sunlight - at least when we went - to use solar heating, but we were able to heat a few pots of water and add it to the bag that way. Loved our experience and would highly recommend to others!",

    "summary": "This modern, dog friendly retreat is a converted shipping container situated at the entry to our 125 acre mountain top retreat which backs up to Pisgah National Forest. Enjoy all the best hikes on the Blue Ridge Parkway just 4 miles away and then head 25 minutes into Asheville for all its amazing food, music, and beer.  We provide the luxury of electricity, heat and air conditioning, with a little taste of being off grid with an outhouse and an outdoor solar shower bag.",
    "space": "Wake up to the crisp outdoor air amidst the trees! Hike our nearby trail along the creek or drive 4 miles to the top of Mount Pisgah and enjoy some of the best hikes on the Blue Ridge Parkway!  Kick back, build a fire, make some s'mores, play some records, pick up a book and enjoy being in the woods.\n\nOur semi off grid cabin has the luxury of electricity mixed with the delight of still feeling like you're camping!   Cell service can be limited (a quick walk up the hill a bit will get you cell service if needed). We provide a comfortable queen size bed, an electric single burner stove top, a mini fridge, a water dispenser for drinking and cooking, coffee maker, a pour over/coffee press option and an outhouse that is emptied weekly. Rinse off using our year around camp solar shower in the outdoor shower space (weather permitting). The glass garage door on the front of the cabin opens to a wooded view and has a bug screen that can be rolled up and down.  During the summer there is a mini split air conditioning unit to keep the space cool.  During the winter, the mini split heater will keep the cabin warm (*if calling for below freezing temps please bring extra blankets to be sure you stay toasty warm at night) \n\nPlease bring your own bedding including pillows/queen size sheets/blankets or sleeping bags.  We will have bedding available for your use if you cannot bring your own stored under the bed.  \n\nWe love dogs and know how hard it is to find a place that allows them to come on vacation with you! Potty trained, well behaved dogs of any size are welcome! Bring their crates and beds. They will need to be left in a crate if left indoors without you there.   \n\nOur calendar is up to date and open a year in advance.  If you can't find the dates you want, check out our other cabins in the area by clicking on our airbnb profile or follow us on insta under Pisgah Highlands where we post last minute cancellations.",
    "access": "This cabin is located on a 125 acres of private land.  We have other airbnb cabins located on the property but they are all very far apart from one another. \n\nOur favorite hiking and swimming holes are near the cabin on the Blue Ridge Parkway. Check out Black Balsam, Graveyard fields, Mount Pisgah, Skinny dip falls, Devils Courthouse and just hiking the Mountain to Sea trail. They often close the parkway for snow/ice conditions during the winter so be sure to check on road closure information before visiting.  Even if the Blue Ridge Parkway is closed, you can still park up there and hike on the Mountain to Sea trail.\n\nNear the cabin, there is an easy hike into Pisgah National Forest that we enjoy hiking along the creek and letting our dogs play in the stream.",
    "notes": "PLEASE READ BEFORE BOOKING:\nBring your own towels, pillows, queen size sheets/blankets or sleeping bags.\n\nThe solar camping shower and outhouse are outside in non climate controlled areas.  \n\nWe have no wifi and the cell phone service is limited at the container.  In some instances you can walk up the road to get better service. \n\nWe will provide Basic cookware,  one burner stove top (it's an induction hot plate which means you have to use our magnetic pots and pans for it to work), mini fridge, coffee maker, tea pot and coffee press are provided. We provide a few 5 gallon jugs of water for cooking, showering and drinking.  You may want to bring your own drinking water.  You can refill your water bottles at our well during the warmer months.  \n\nWe have a record player there with a few records for you to try out!\n\nWe are dog friendly!  Any dogs, any size. We don't discriminate. They cannot be left in the container unattended unless they are in crates.\n\nWe have 2 other off grid cabins on this property.  All the cabins are very secluded from one another. This cabin is located closest to the entrance gate and our storage for our cleaning supplies is attached to this container.  \n\nOUTDOOR SHOWER: We provide a  solar shower year around that is a bag you heat up in the sun or heat water up on the stove.  In the winter it may be too cold outside to want to shower outdoors. We have a list of alternative ideas for places to shower during the winter in our house manual.  Due to Covid- many of our options are not available right now. \n\nOUTHOUSE: We use a toilet service that come and empty on Mondays around noon. They will have to walk across the front deck to reach the toilet.",
    "neighborhood": "Our gated property backs up to Pisgah National Forest and is situated at the very end of the road.  We have 3 other off grid cabins on our 125 acres...but they are all isolated from one another.  If you drive 4 miles up to the Blue Ridge Parkway, you will have access to some of the best long range views, hiking and swimming holes in the area. Check for Parkway road closures in the winter...although that's the best time to go hiking up there when no one else is there! Grab a sunset dinner at the Pisgah Inn or drive into Asheville and enjoy the amazing food, music and beer scene!  \n\nCatch the Friday night drum circle at Pritchard Park in downtown Asheville, float the French Broad river in the summer, visit the Biltmore house, Tour New Belgium and Sierra Nevada Breweries.  Mountain bike in Bent Creek, Mills River and Dupont.  Find swimming holes! Go fly fishing. Hike to the top of Mount Pisgah or Black Balsam.  Ride the Lazoom tour.  Hit up Navitat's zip lines.  Look up the Downtown After 5 and Riverlink summer music series.  Enjoy touring all the breweries. Go on the Riverarts art stroll. Shop on Lexington Avenue and support my favorite places like Tops and LP's. Have drinks on the patio at the Grove Park Inn. Catch the sunset at one of the many roof top bars like Hemmingways.",
    "transit": "The road leading to our cabin is mostly paved. There are some rough spots in the road leading up to our gate.  It is a steep grade, but can be navigated by any car. If you are scared of steep, back country,  rough, mountain driving then this may not be the place for you.  AWD is preferred but not necessary.  \n\nIf it snows we will reschedule or offer a full refund.",
    "interaction": "We tend to give our guests their space and let them adventure on their own, unless they ask for specific help on something.  We don't live on the property.

    "summary": "Step into this peaceful oasis inspired by the colors of the caves.  Every space has expansive windows bringing the outside into the comfort of your room.  Whether you are soaking in the hot tub, lounging in our hammocks or kicked back by the fire pit we hope you will love the feeling of peacefulness we have curated.  Located only 15 minutes to Cedar Falls and Ash Cave, and under an hour from Columbus.",
    "notes": "We strive to provide a five star experience for all who stay with us.  However, like all places especially those in rural locations, this cabin has it’s quirks that guest should be aware of before booking.  The cabin is located in a beautiful natural setting.  Sometimes the ‘nature’ will find its way inside as well as on the porch.  Also, as you are lounging on the back porch you may get a visit from one of the several neighborhood dogs that roam the surrounding woods.  They are all very friendly and also respond very well to a stern \"go home!\" both of these issues are things that we are continually trying work on, however we want to our guest to be aware of before they book with us.",
    "neighborhood": "We are the second to last house on a dead-end street and part of a 20 acre parcel with 2 other cabins on it that are accessed with their own private driveways .  There are long term residents on either side of the cabin that can not be seen from our property but close enough that loud music will travel to them.  We ask that you help us be good neighbors by turning down the volume after 10 P.M.",
    "transit": "This house is off of a narrow gravel road, however it is surprisingly quickly plowed during snows.   Any vehicle should have no problem accessing our driveway.",
    "interaction": "We live in the Columbus area and will do our best to be available by communication through the Air BnB platform.  We also have relationships with local service providers should any maintenance issue arise.",
    "house_rules": "All guests must be listed on the reservation.\n● Copy of government-issued photo ID required.\n● Trash bags. Please drop your trash bags at the roadside dumpster.\n● Smoking is not permitted anywhere inside or outside of the property except for by the picnic table or fire pit. We have provided high quality furniture for our guests, please help us keep it that way for future guests.\n● Fires must be attended to by an adult at all times and fully extinguished before leaving the area. Registered guest assumes all responsibility and liability for fires in fireplaces, fire tables, and fire pits. Fires outside designated areas are not permitted at any time. In extreme weather conditions, outdoor fires may be prohibited.\n● We do our best to make sure all amenities are in good working order. Occasionally electronics, hot tub, and other mechanical equipment will malfunction. We will do our best to repair these items in a timely manner, but will not make any rental concession for time without these items. Likewise, loss of electricity, water, or other “Acts of God” that are outside of our control will not result in a refund of any monies paid. We ask that you follow all guidelines and policies regarding the use of amenities in order to keep them functioning at peak efficiency.\n● The reservation is subject to immediate and non-refundable cancellation if guests become disruptive, unruly, or unregistered guests are on the property. \n● Guest agrees to assume all responsibility for any accident, injury or damage that may result in or about the premises, to persons or property, and that the Owner and its agents shall not be held liable, or responsible for such injury, accident, or damage. Guest assumes the risk involved with the use of the hot tub and any and all other rental amenity and agrees to save harmless and indemnify the Owner and its agents from any and all claims and liability of any nature which may arise by reason of the use of the same renter or others using the same during renters occupancy. Guest assumes the responsibility of all guests during reservation time.\n● Absolutely NO hunting of any kind is permitted anywhere on the property.\n● No firearms or fireworks permitted anywhere on the property.",

The containers are located on adjoining lots so that they can be rented independently or together for a larger group. The siting of the units on the lots ensures plenty privacy and lots of space to spread out.  If the container is not available for your dates see the listing for Modern Beach Container Home #1.\nThe architecturally engineered space measures 320 square feet and is comfortable inside and out. The interiors offer all the amenities you need plus some interesting details such as Casper mattresses, spacious bathrooms, Paperstone countertops, and original mahogany hardwood floors. \nLarge teak outdoor showers are the best! (there is a spacious indoor shower) Canopies of hardwood trees provide shade so you can enjoy the ample decks and yard.\nThere is a public beach access at the end of the street which offers an easy beach entrance and parking spaces.\n\nWe do not provide sheets or towels - pillows and comforters are provided. Additionally we are taking all CDC recommended cleaning and disinfecting steps between guests. Seaside Linens can rent linens and we are happy to assist in any way.\n\nProvided:\nCoffee maker and filters\nSoap\nShampoo\nPaper towels \nToilet paper\nPack light!\n\nBring:\nFull or queen sheets\nBath towels\nBeach towels\nSunscreen\nBathing suit",

Dahlonega is a great place to visit with a nice little downtown to explore, and you can't beat having the national Forrest at the end of the road!\r\nI'm an avid outdoorsman and love biking, being on the water, skiing, camping, you name it.  Always happy to give advice for the best spots in the  surrounding areas- I am on the road for my work a lot, so I have plenty of knowledge about this great area!",

The internet was also not working properly so we could only connect one device at a time and this prevented us from working from the house on the day we needed to. For the price paid I was disappointed in what was delivered, especially given the size of the cleaning fee (which is sufficient to cover the cost of a professional cleaning). I think if the cleanliness of the house can be improved (especially so that pet hair between stays is cleared and cleaned), this would be a magical place to stay for a short romantic weekend. We made the best of it because ultimately we did not spend much time at the actual home, but was a bit disappointed",

Nestled between 2 cliffs, isolated from everything (but super close to town and anything you may need), we did not feel like we were in Ohio.\n\nWe love Hocking Hills but had never brought the kids. Now, I believe this will be a yearly trip for us hopefully staying here again at Roca Box. The kids were fascinated by the use of 3 shipping containers to build & create this magical place, but the truth is, my husband & I were just as enamored. \n\nThe Roca Box was well stocked with everything you could think of needing. Our favorite was enjoying the evenings out by the fire, making S’mores, under the string lights and stars. I’m sad we didn’t explore the property until the last day. You do not want to miss exploring the 75 acres which consists of 2 waterfalls. You don’t have to really leave Roca your entire stay if you didn’t want to! \n\nWe really hope to be back! Thank you for sharing your piece of heaven with the world, Emily & Seth!",

    "summary": "The Roca Box Hop - pronounced [ROH] + [KUH] is another build by the Box Hop team (Emily & Seth Britt). Roca means “rock” in Portuguese, and we couldn’t think of a more fitting name for this house, a whimsical home wedged between towering rocks in the beautiful Hocking Hills area of Southern Ohio. \n\nBuilt using three containers - two 40’ and one 20’ has a private deck featuring a hot tub and a chiminea for those outside fire nights, nestled between the rocks.\n\nThe interior is decked out with a whimsical déco, filled with color and texture, bringing a touch of luxury to this rugged outdoor setting.\n\nThe Roca features two bedrooms, 1.5 baths, a hot tub, and a next-level custom design. The home is big enough to host 5-6 people. \n\nLastly, it's worth noting that the property is a total of 75 acres, home to 2 waterfalls and a plethora of hiking possibilities right on site.\n\nWe are SO thrilled to share the newest Box Hop, the Roca, with you, and we cannot wait to host you.\n\nXo -\nThe Britt's",

Sheree is a super responsive and really friendly host which helped me feel safe, right at home and well taken care of. I appreciated all the notes, suggestions of places to go, instructions on making a fire (first time for me and it was so easy) and all my questions answered. You'll definitely enjoy your stay.\n\nThank you Sheree! I hope to come stay again in the future :)",

The location felt quiet and secluded but was also a quick drive to town and great hiking spots. The hot tub was great after our hikes. We were also visited by a family of deer one morning. We loved watching them from inside the cabin. We had the pleasure of meeting Stacy and John and we really enjoyed our time with them. Highly recommend a stay at this tiny cabin and we hope to come back for another stay.",

    "summary": "RETREAT: This home is secluded, yet 6 minutes to town. Come and enjoy fresh air and a clean, healthy environment. Luxury 399 sq. foot  high quality interior furnishings. Two tv's, one electric fireplace, hot tub,  two mini-split ductless air con/heater units, wifi, fire pit, hot tub, cute covered porch , private, quiet neighborhood walks .\n\nPETS: Let us know if you are bringing pets. we ask that you be sure they are in crates when you're not home and clean their paws and not allow on furniture.",
    "space": "A beautiful forest setting where you can hear the birds all around, see bright red cardinals as well as deer and the occasional bald eagle or red fox.\n\nIf you've never stayed in a \"tiny home cabin\", you'll be shocked how roomy and comfy this is. Come enjoy your private mountain hide-away, yet very close to town. \n\nThe kitchen is surprisingly large with a four burner stove, full size oven, large microwave and full size fridge/freezer with ice maker. There are ample supplies for cooking, plates, cups, bowls, etc. Plenty of towels. The loft is almost like it's own private space (kinda like a tree house for the kids)  with a queen memory foam mattress and a twin memory foam mattress, overhead light and place to store luggage. The loft windows look out on the tree canopy.\n\nThe hot tub is steps from the cabin and in a clearing so you can see the stars at night, have the fireflies around you in the summer, yet secluded and private.  (my husband told me to write that part.)\n\nWe invested in high end memory foam mattresses for the king bed and the queen and twin bed as well as a luxuriously soft and comfy velvety blue sofa. Two tv's--one in the bedroom and one in the family room. Both are 43\" LG smart roku tv's.  There are also two mini-split ductless aircon/heater units so you can close the door to your bedroom and choose the temp that you want. \n\nReally cool exterior lights at night and a comfy and private covered porch.",
    "access": "The entire cabin and surrounding area are yours to enjoy.",
    "notes": "If you're bringing a pet, please know that there are no leash laws in our area. There are some neighborhood dogs. ALL are friendly and you may see them during your walks in the area.\n\nWe've had the hot tub break once (due to a guest that mis-used it) in the entire history of the tiny home cabin. We started renting it in July of 2019. That said, should the hot tub break, there is no refund on your stay. We endeavor to keep it in great working order, but accidents happen and repairmen are swamped in our area, so it can take some time to get repairs done.",
    "neighborhood": "At the bottom of Canterbury Lane is the South Fork of the New River. Walk down the hill, play in the river, kayak, tube, or just take walks in the countryside.",
    "transit": "Uber and Lyft are available if needed.",
    "interaction": "We don't bite.\n\nWe love to meet new people and hear your stories. \n\nOur feelings get hurt if you don't have a 5-star stay because of something we neglected to do. We will do our best to make it right, just let us know as soon as you see something amiss, not after you departed. We do get kinda perturbed if you don't have a 5-star stay because you didn't read the description, well. Thanks :-)",
    "house_rules": "This is a no shoe tiny home, please leave your shoes at the front door.\n\nWe want ALL of our guests to have a 5-star stay. If you arrive and something is amiss, please do let us know right away so we can make it right. We're not perfect and do make mistakes. We'd rather correct it right away than hear about it after your stay. \n\nJust a reminder, that we like pets. But we have nice furniture and if you are out and about and don't take your pets, they need to be left in a crate. No pets on the furniture and please clean paws before entering. Being a respectful pet owner helps us to continue to not charge a pet fee.\n\nWe ask that you not hold large parties with guests outside of those that are already part of the rental.\n\nNo loud outside noises after 11:00 p.m. Sound carries in the mountains and that's the cut-off time for our local county ordinance.\n\nHave Fun: Enjoy this beautiful area; Ask us questions via the Airbnb app if you need something. \n\nNOTE: There will be a $75 extra charge if there's a smell of marijuana, cigarette smoke or vaping inside the the cabin and we have to bring in a air purifier to clear the smell\n\nAIRBNB HAS SUGGESTED WE WRITE THIS AS OWNERS OF HOT TUBS:  \"update your listing description about its availability; that there are times where it is being repaired or is inactive. If this is clearly outlined and you are as transparent as possible prior to confirmation and check-in then if the guest proceeds with a cancellation, all refunds will be in accordance with your cancellation policy.\"",

The basketball court and hottub provided great entertainment for the kids when we weren't out hiking. We also loved visiting The Barn on the neighboring property and petting the goats, dog, donkey and cows. The construction, design and decor of the house and surrounding properties was impressive. You can tell that a great deal of thought went into them. So modern and cool yet so cozy and welcoming. Location was great - easy drive to any of the hiking trails and the general store was just down the road.  We would definitely visit any of Creative Cabins properties again!",

She had supplies there in case you forgot (toothbrushes, q-tips, chargers, soap and shampoo like an hotel, etc.) and supplied plenty of options for the keurig with all the fixings. I wish I found this sooner since it’s a great distance to visit my son in Athens. He just graduated and it was an easy commute to and from campus. Everyone loved the basketball court inside and the jacuzzi and the fire pit and the outdoor swings. It was all just amazing! I’m a little sad I didn’t get to visit with the animals but I got to see them from the car a few times. The area is kind of a dead zone for service but the Wi-Fi was good in the cabin and truthfully, I liked not being bothered during my stay. It was the perfect getaway.",

We also appreciated that you had Netflix for your guests - it was really nice to be gone all day and then come back at night and watch a movie. Being that there is no service only wifi - it was nice to be able to watch a TV show or movie at the end of the night. We hope to be back!",

There are remote control  blackout curtains for instant privacy. I felt safe and comfortable. The bed was cozy and I loved the mood lighting, heated bathroom floor, and towel warmers for an added luxurious touch. I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend if you're considering booking!",

Now, after additions to the house, a heritage turkey farm, chickens, woodland tea house, and many versions of the vegetable garden,  I look forward to sharing it with the GuestHouse visitors. \nMy landscape design/build business has kept me creative and physically active for 43 years.  It's also allowed me lots of travel adventures, especially in the winter.\nMy heritage turkey farm fills my desire to provide local organic meat, and help preserve heritage breeds and sustainable farming.  \nI live on the property with my partner and musician nephew,  poodle and cats, and a diversity of fauna and flora  :~)",

It was exactly the peaceful retreat we needed and hoped for. We loved exploring the grounds and meeting the turkeys, and we kept marveling at the wildflowers and peacefulness, and the ingenuity and artistry of the house itself. Barbara was an amazing host - she communicated clearly and frequently with us, and was super kind and helpful, and we also really appreciated the helpful guidebook, which gave us a lot of ideas re: places to visit. We loved our stay, wish we could have stayed longer, and we will definitely be visiting Barbara’s place again in the future! Thank you, Barbara!",

    "space": "The house is unique not only because it's made from a repurposed insulated tractor trailer, but also because it utilizes many recycled and repurposed materials, such as the 1960's bamboo kitchen cabinets, recycled hardwood flooring and windows, and many antique elements.\n\nThere's plenty of nature to explore on the 160 acres of forest and stream, along with the farm’s free ranging chickens and fenced heritage turkeys.

    "notes": "10% discount offered to repeat guests!\nPETS are welcome with an additional $25 fee.  They are not allowed on the furniture and must always be supervised.  If you have to leave them alone, they should be in a crate you bring, or your car.  If they are used to being on the furniture and you feel it would be difficult to keep them off,  please bring coverings to protect the furniture.\nYou must also please make sure your dogs don't bother the free ranging chickens across the road !!!   \nI have a new Bernie-doodle puppy on the property ;)",
    "neighborhood": "The GuestHouse is off a rural dirt road, 2mi from the town of Erin, NY.  The driveway is flat with plenty of parking.  The 2 other homes on the property are not visible, but are within a short walking distance.  The closest neighbor is .2mi away.  We're all friendly distant neighborly neighbors!\nErin is located at what I like to call the “hub of the wheel” surrounded by Ithaca, Corning, Watkins Glen, Elmira, Sayre, and the Finger Lakes wineries, breweries, and parks.  Branch out to explore the Southern Tier and Finger Lakes, or visit for special events and locations such as the Finger Lakes Wine Festival, Watkins Glen Car Races, Cornell University,  Ithaca College,  Elmira College, and the Corning Glass Museum.",
    "transit": "Park Hill Rd is a beautiful narrow two lane dirt road, off a state hwy.  In the spring it can be muddy and rutty during rainy weather.  In the winter, the town does a good job of keeping up with plowing and cindering.  It is not necessary to have 4wheel drive, but good tires are needed in winter and spring.\nUber will come to the GuestHouse!!\nBring hiking boots for getting around on the property!  And snow shoes for deep snow if you want to trek the woods,",
    "interaction": "Barb is available through texts or phone calls, and is happy to show you the highlights of the farm and how to walk the trails.  The on-site heritage turkey farm is unique in this country!",
    "house_rules": "PET REQUESTS -\nDogs are not allowed on the sofas or beds.  If your dog is used to being on your furniture and will have a hard time staying off the Guesthouse furniture, please bring coverings to protect the beds and sofas.\nThere are free ranging chickens on our farm next door to the Guesthouse.  Please keep your dog contained to protect our chickens!!  \nThanks in advance for being responsible dog owners.  It's so fun to include our dogs and give them a country vacation too!!",

The place is secluded and private and quiet during the nights. It was super clean and was easy to use all the amenities. I was able to sleep without a white noise machine because the summer cicadas were so loud and peaceful. I even left some of my stuff in my car overnight and felt safe as a solo traveler. Thank you guys for the best one night stay I could have asked for on my way home. I’ll definitely try to stay here more often during my trips back and forth to the Midwest!",

    "summary": "Want to be totally immersed in nature?  Your 289 sqft mountain escape is literally in the middle of the woods.\n\nYour huge deck and cozy hot tub have a panoramic nature view with a seating area, fire table, and grill.\n\nWe opened mid November 2022 and are enjoying every guest we've hosted.\n\nTraveling with friends, family or need more space? Check out all of our listings located on the same mountain!\n\nFollow us on Insta - @stayinavl",
    "space": "Your 289sqft home includes a cozy living room, a kitchen with frig, one burner cooktop and microwave, dining bar, bath, and bedroom with 40\" Smart TV. Living room windows look directly at the treetops.\n\nThe bathroom has a fully tiled shower, heated floors, and fluffy robes as you step outside the shower. \n\nYou will enjoy your huge deck in the middle of the woods. The hot tub is ready for you!  You have a cozy seating area, a propane fire table to warm your toes, and a grill to cook an amazing meal to be enjoyed on the deck or at the dining bar.  \n\nA spare propane tank is available at the end of your parking spot in case the fire table or grill run out of propane during your visit.  \n\nYou will see a Ring camera pointing at outdoor entrance and road.\n\nYour home is very modern. White walls and great decor welcome you into your living space.  Living area has a two person leather couch with a fuzzy couch throw for those chilly winter nights. Your 40\" TV in the bedroom completes the setting for a relaxing night at home.  \nYou have total privacy once you arrive so we don't have window coverings.  Your total glass front oasis is too gorgeous to cover with shades.  \n\nYour queen size bed has 100% cotton sheets and a duvet cover for your fluffy down comforter.  Two firm bamboo pillows and two soft pillows complete the equation for a restful and relaxing night. \n\nYou will see three other homes as you drive to your tiny house.  We have a long term renter on a separate portion of the property with his own driveway. You may occasionally hear when he plays his guitar. You will pass another vacation rental on your way and then about 1/4 mile further down the driveway you will come to your private vacation rental. The road to your place is a Two Way road so please take it slow in case another car is on it's way in or out.\n\nGentle reminder that no type of smoking is allowed and pets are not allowed.  There will be a $325 ionization fee is smoking occurs.  Thanks for being considerate of our home!\n\nWe are in the middle of nature, so be prepared to share space with deer, bear, snakes, coyotes, bugs, and fireflies.\n\nAll linens are provided- we have thought of everything for your stay - but of course let us know if you need anything at all to complete your amazing stay in our beautiful mountains.\n\nA couple of resources for your Asheville visit: romanticasheville on Insta and AVL Ride for your transportation needs.",
    "access": "You have private access to the entire tiny house and the outside area. \n\nYour space only allows 2 people, and additional guests or visitors cannot be accommodated at any time during your visit.  You have gravel parking spots for two cars.\n\nFor our winter guests: snow is absolutely gorgeous in Asheville!  Sitting in the hot tub surrounded by snow is an incredible and relaxing experience. IF it snows during your stay, you won't be able to drive in and out and will need to park at the top of the driveway and walk about 400 yards to get to your home. Occasionally we have snow and ice that causes power to go out, and your well pump will not work without power, so you will not have water.  If this happens for a prolonged period of time, you're welcome to leave with a refund for any unused nights. Of course, let us know if either of these items would be a problem for you during our rare snowstorms, and we'll work with you.\n\nFor those who might not be used to driving in our beautiful mountains, the best way to climb out of the driveway is to put your vehicle in the lowest gear possible, gain a bit of momentum, then stay at that same momentum until you reach the paved flat spot near the top of the driveway.",
    "notes": "Brand New Construction November 2022.\n\nWe have DirectTV and AT&T Internet.  Internet speed is usually between 5-10 MBps. You'll be able to check email, use social media, etc.  Working from this location is not recommended IF you need a super fast connection.\n\nWe have family members with severe allergies to smoke and pets, so unfortunately, we will have to charge a $350 ionization fee if either occurs.  Thanks for being considerate of our home!",
    "neighborhood": "Your tiny home is on 4.5 acres shared by one other tiny home and our long term renter, Rob.   Once you get to your vacation spot, you have total privacy.  When you sit in the hot tub, you will feel like you're sitting in the middle of the treetops.\n\nWhen we timed the drive, it took  20 minutes to get to the French Broad Chocolate Lounge in the center of downtown Asheville, and should be on your list of places to visit!  \n\nYou will see a Ring camera pointing at the walkway and road. \n\nThe Blue Ridge Parkway entrance is 15 minutes away.  Cataloochee Ski Resort is 45 minutes away.  Max Patch is a must for those who love to hike.  We are 20-25 minutes from the Biltmore Estate.  For Christmas visitors, Biltmore is a must!  For those visiting in the Spring, make a plan to see the tulips, and Jazz Festivals at the Winery.  Fall Concerts at the Estate are so much fun!\n\nFor adventure seekers, Navitat Ziplining is a blast - you truly zipline through trees! And of course white water rafting is close by.",

It was a perfect fit for 2 people and the beds slept comfortably. The outdoor relaxation spots are unique, beautiful & private. \n\nIf you are going to Franklin to spend time in the airbnb, this may not be the best fit for you. If you rent this tiny home to be outdoors and relax outdoors, I would suggest this space because of the fire pit, grill, corn hole, and big family style dinner table outside (right in the valley). \n\nCool spot overall, but definitely meant for the renter that will be going & exploring.",

I woke up to deer in the area and it was peaceful to just watch them forge and graze. \n\nThe tiny house so my style with the decor and furniture. I could see myself living in her home, for sure.  We did not bring my kids with us on this trip, but my husband and I can see our girls hanging out in the loft area. \n\nNatalie was responsive, informative of all the activities and surrounding areas. I never been to NC. I was looking to decompress and align my soul with God and Source, and I found that in her beautiful space.\n\nI know it has been mentioned,  the internet would be an issue, and while internet would be great to have, I understand the circumstances of the situation as well.  This was a minor minor cink in the trip, it wouldn't change my mind of returning.",

    "summary": "Welcome to Happy Shack Mountainside Hiker’s Hideaway!! She may be tiny but she packs a big punch! Our tiny home is located in a small tiny -home community called Bear Pen Cove in Franklin, NC. Just 12 minutes from downtown Franklin, yet you are in your own peaceful world in the woods with gorgeous long-range mountain views! Your home base when exploring the Great Smoky Mountains. Perched on the back ridge of the community on 4.73 acres of land w/long-range mountain views. You will fall in love.",
    "space": "The Happy Shack Mountainside-Hiker’s Hideaway is a brand new tiny house vacation rental available for you!  The home is nestled in up on a ridge at the very back of a tiny home community.  We designed the firepit area to be a magical and natural oasis for you to enjoy with a gazebo made out of trees from our land, a swing, a corn hole area and even a nature picnic table. \nIn late summer we will be building a deck on the front of the home which will provide even more outdoor enjoyment. \n\nAs you may already know, while in the mountains you can lose cell service, although our cell and personal hotspots work just fine (AT+T). We do have LIMITED WIFI. We encourage our guests to utilize their own personal hotspots as we only have limited WiFi, just 100mb of WIFI per month via a hot spot at the tiny. \n\nTreat this time as a true getaway and try to unplug, get out and explore nature! \n\nAlso, please note and print out the directions that we send to you. Our home is not located via GPS, so the directions will take you to a church that is located just before you turn down the hill into the community. We provide detailed instructions on how to navigate up to the tiny home. ;)",
    "access": "When entering the community, please remember that you cannot see our tiny from the entrance. You have to drive up a steep hill to get to it. Also, please note that there are permanent residences here, so please DO NOT STOP at any of the private residences.  Do not stop at the first home that you see on your left or at any of the other tiny homes. We want to keep our neighborhood as peaceful and as private as possible. Hiker’s Hideaway is the very last home in the community and tucked into the back ridge. Please not that when you park, you will need to reverse straight back and turn around to head back down the hill to depart. We do not have a circular drive.",
    "notes": "Absolutely NO PETS. Due to the owner’s severe allergies and asthma and our past experiences with our other rentals with guests sneaking in pets, we have to enforce a strict $500 fine for any signs of pets. \n\nSame goes for smoking and vaping. No smoking in or on the property. Any evidence of will result in a $500 fine.",
    "neighborhood": "Hiker’s Hideaway is located in a quaint tiny house community called Bear Pen Cove.  We are just 12 minutes from downtown Franklin where there are shops, grocery stores, coffee shops, breweries and more. There are approximately 30 tiny homes speckled throughout the community. Most of the homes are in the lower valley and our home is located up a steep hill on the back ridge of the community. There are just 7 tiny homes on the back ridge and we own 4.75 acre as with just two homes on the acreage, Hiker’s Hideaway and Stargazer, so there is plenty of room to roam around and hike up the steep ridge, if you choose to do so.",
    "transit": "You will need a car that can handle a steep hill. There is no turn-around on our lot for parking, so you will have to back up and angle around to depart.",
    "interaction": "We will be texting you the day of your arrival to provide the access details. If there is an emergency, feel free to text or call us.",
    "house_rules": "NO PETS. NO SMOKING OR VAPING. $500 fee if evidence of.  NO SHOES INSIDE. MUST WAS DISHES PRIOR TO DEPARTING. $25 FEE FOR LEAVING DIRTY DISHES.",

If your like me and like to clean a little upon arrivals advise bring your own stuff because there was nothing in the house. Also bring your own blow dryer! Overall it wasn’t a bad experience.",

    "summary": "This is one of 4 guest cabins on the property. We are an adults-only venue except for special Family Weeks. Check out the images to see our kid-friendly dates.\n\nThe High Line cabin is an upcycled shipping container located on The Ridge section of the property. It's cantilevered above an old-growth forest, perched  70’ above Perry Lake. Finished in 2022, the premium interior feels fresh and modern. Guests enjoy lake access, encounters with horses, bird watching, and acres of hiking trails.",
    "space": "Your cabin is an upcycled shipping container. Brand new in 2022, its clever design is stocked with goodies like heated towel bars, quartz countertops, and fast WiFi. Huge, fixed windows make it feel light and modern (but don’t worry… there are shades in case you need a break from all that nature!). Around you are a mix of open horse pastures, densely wooded trails, and a natural lakefront. \n\nThis cabin is nearby other units but has been carefully placed to offer a private, 360-degree view of the surrounding wilderness.\n\nStillwater Stables also hosts a revolving art show; guests will find their cabins filled with original art from local artists that is available for sale.",
    "access": "Guests can enjoy the trails that wind throughout the property and can access the lake via our new dock. There’s also a paddle boat available to use.",
    "notes": "Your cabin is tucked into the woods! It gets dark and the footing can be tricky so please try to check in during daylight hours. If this is not possible, let us know and we will assist you.",
    "neighborhood": "As I bet you can imagine - our farm is located in a rural area! Expect to drive about 2 miles along a dirt road before you arrive at the turn into our driveway, which is almost a quarter mile long.",
    "transit": "Your car will be the best way to explore the area. \n\nAlso, we have a private ride service provider (a former Uber and Lyft driver) that services the farm. Please request that information after booking.",
    "interaction": "We live on the property so you'll likely see us around! We are happy to greet you, share time with the horses, or answer any questions you have, but otherwise expect to have a very quiet and private experience.",
    "house_rules": "Special Events and Commercial Use:\n\nFor extra guests, special events, or commercial use - please reach out to us while booking to discuss your plans. Additional fees, permits, or accommodations might be required. \n\nRead This Before Entering the Hot Tub:\n\nThe detergents, oils, and chemicals found in body lotions, deodorants, and makeup will clog the spa filters and foul the water so you must remove these before entering. If special cleaning is needed to restore the spa water after your stay, then a materials fee of $75 will be assessed along with any additional costs resulting from issuing refunds or cancellations to the guests who are scheduled to arrive after you (and who will not be able to use the hot tub due to this servicing).\n\nNeutral Scent Policy:\n\nWe aim to provide a scent-neutral environment to ensure that each guest experiences a healthy, comfortable, and enjoyable stay. Please respect the next visitor by not using heavy perfumes, medicinal oils, cannabis, or air fresheners.  Burning, vaporizing, smoking, diffusing, or cooking anything that can be detected in the air or on the fabrics after your departure could violate this policy and you may be charged up to a $250 restoration fee.",

We love nature, so we'll often be outside hiking, camping  or relaxing on our front porch. We love cooking, reading, making wood fired pizzas, traveling and learning. We have all personality types in our family, so there is never a dull moment!  When we travel we love finding unique airbnb places to stay. No boring hotel rooms for us! A few of our favorite destinations are Tulumn, Mexico, New River Gorge, West Virginia, The Highway 1 on the California coast. There's nothing like cruising down the highway in a convertible, with the fresh, piney smell of the Redwoods , and the wild crashing of the ocean and the moisture of the ocean in the air! We love life, and God has richly blessed us with one that is rich in experience, and we want to pass it on to you while you stay in our little corner of the world.",

We enjoyed using the outdoor shower and HUGE tub. There was plenty of hot water. We enjoyed the outdoor gas fire pit - perfect at night when the temperature cools down. Although it felt remote, it is located just down the road from the restaurants Der Dutchman and Rebecca's Bistro. We ate at both during our stay and were very happy with the convenience of good restaurants so near our Airbnb. This was the perfect stay for my husband and me - relaxing and giving us a chance to appreciate nature without having to rough it. We hadn't realized that there was an indoor shower at this location as well, so there are three bathing options at this one tiny container house.",

We had a beautiful girls weekend celebrating each other and this cabin was the perfect place to have a relaxing weekend.  Location wise it was about 20-30 minutes from most of the major attractions in the Hocking Hills area, including restaurants.  However, I feel that the trade off for the tranquility of the area was well worth having to drive a short while for those things.\nI can not stress enough how lovely it was to have the top deck where we could hang out and enjoy ourselves during the day, and then when the insects became too much at night the screened lower deck to continue enjoying nature at night.  We also used the lower deck to have a yoga class, which was amazing with fans to cool us and the birds providing the soundtrack.\nThe kitchen was well stocked.  The bed linens were comfortable and there were plenty of towels that were ready and clean for us.  Loved this place!",

I have traveled a lot and I've never felt instantly at home like this. This is a sacred space. Also it was even larger than I expected! Such a generous and comfortable space. I loved cooking in the kitchen, stargazing at night, waking up to the mountain range and I used the spa/sauna every day followed by the magical shower (with eucalyptus spray!). My routine became grounded, calm and regenerative. Margaretville has adorable stores and there's an incredible farmer's market on Saturdays. Everyone is friendly and accommodating. And there are magical local spots to dip into the water. I wish I could move up here. Young, thank you for a truly transformative experience AND for welcoming not only me but my kitty, Count!! We are forever grateful and will absolutely return!",

Thankfully, we were able to bring along our two big dogs to enjoy the outdoor with us. \nThis property is even more stunning and roomy in person. The bed and couches are comfortable, the deck and views are gorgeous, and we did not feel like we were missing anything. Two bathrooms is a plus and, of course, having a yoga studio, sauna, fire pit, and jacuzzi are bonuses. As someone who is paranoid about being in the “middle of nowhere,” I did not feel unsafe at all. The people in Halcottsville are extremely friendly and welcoming. Young was very responsive, and instructions were simple.\nAlthough there was rain for half of our stay, we never felt bored. We highly recommend Candace’s private yoga session, Susan’s Pleasant Pheasant Farm for kayaking/swimming, and Sweet Pea Supply Co for lunch and ice cream. Halcottsville neighbors other amazing towns. We cannot wait to return!",

I felt right at home at the container cottage and everything we want to go see from downtown to different restaurants was all within a 15 minute drive of the location. John and sandy made my stay incredibly enjoyable. Thanks again for having us!",

Both living areas are situated closely together yet offer enough privacy from each other. \n\nWe stayed in the contemporary barn and the hosts were onsite at the farmhouse should we need any assistance. \n\nThe barn is a beautiful updated space with a kitchenette that didn’t cause issue for us : namely no freezer available but a good sized bar fridge on site, a microwave, toaster oven, kettle, coffee machine all available for our use.\n\nThe bbq & hot tub is situated on the farmhouse grounds which is less ideal, however if renting the whole property this would be a non-issue for privacy & convenience. \n\nThe trail to the water was not stroller accessible (a non issue for older kids) & I would however bring boots if you plan on venturing to the water. All in all, we found great value for the price, excellent location & space - thx you!",

    "summary": "Relax in Niagara’s wine country and enjoy the tranquility of being in a nature's paradise on the water. A mix of modern architecture and old-world charm makes this stunning century old barn, perched over 16th Mile Creek, an inspired vacation destination and offsite work location. Set amongst vineyards and orchards on an estate minutes from wineries, restaurants and downtown St Catharines, just off the QEW, our industrial chic wine country retreat sleeps 2 adults and 1 child.",
    "space": "Just one hour from Toronto and Buffalo, the Vineyard Barn's stunning spaces and storybook setting make it a great Niagara wine country escape for family, friends, and co-workers alike. It's that much better shared together; strolling through acres of vineyards and orchards, spending an afternoon on the sandy beach just down the water, bird watching for bald eagles perched on the tall pines, enjoying the stars and tranquil sounds of nature from the porch swing on the rooftop deck - simple pleasures to help disconnect and unwind. \n\nThe barn's private, luxurious accommodations features 20 ft ceilings, polished and heated concrete floors, century old barn board, chic living/dining areas and a separate den/bedroom with a day bed for lounging or sleeping. The pass through kitchenette with a large island and comfy counter chairs acts as a great work space with high speed internet. A thoughtfully designed mix of vintage farmhouse furnishings and contemporary furniture makes for comfortable living. \n\nUnwind in the hot tub after a day of wine tasting or spend the afternoon reading on the rooftop deck with an oversized sofa swing overlooks vineyards and orchards. If you're lucky,  you may spot the family of Bald Eagles that nest in the twin pines. The multi-acre property has a number of lookouts and seating areas with water and vineyard views that guests are welcome to enjoy.  \n\nLess than 10 minute from 13th Street Winery, Cave Springs, Pearl Morissette and 15 minutes to 50+ local wineries, including Vineland Estates, Megalomaniac, 30 Bench, Angel's Gate and more. Only 25 minute from Niagara-on-the-Lake and Niagara Falls. Don't miss downtown Jordan Station, 10 mins away, with boutique stores, art galleries and bakeries. See our guide for more recommendations for hiking trails, wineries and restaurants.",
    "access": "Guests have full access to the property including the bbq and hot tub",
    "notes": "For groups of 10, there is a second unit located on the property. Please look for \"Vineyard Farmhouse on the Water\" on AirBnB for availability and booking details.",
    "neighborhood": "The Vineyard Barn is very private, perched on the water amongst acres of vineyards and orchards that are wonderful to stroll or bike through. Jordan, in the Town of Lincoln, is part of Niagara's Benchlands, bordering Niagara-on-the-lake, a short drive from Toronto or Buffalo, New York. \n\nNiagara's Benchlands is a charming wine country pocket home to beautiful trails, quaint towns peppered with boutiques, farm-to-table restaurants, and, most importantly, some outstanding wine. With over 50 vineyards featuring many of the provinces best, boutique wineries, most are family run, award-winning estates, set in the majestic natural beauty of the Niagara Escarpment. The Benchlands landscape is often described as Niagara’s Sonoma Valley - unpretentious, high quality, down to earth and friendly. The rolling landscape is serene as you travel the route along sloping vineyards and roadside fruit stands. Visit farmers markets, hike scenic trails or shop in the most unique boutique shops in the historic Jordan Village shopping district. \n\nThe property is also just 20 mins away from Niagara-on-the-Lake offering even more wineries and restaurants and 25 mins mins from Niagara Falls.",

Giant windows everywhere really let the light in and set the stage for a beautiful home. The hot tub and sauna are great and the kitchen is very nice.\n\nOverall a great stay but there were a few issues. The Wi-Fi is rough. You will not be able to stream from any device to the projector due to the poor Wi-Fi. We checked throughout and the upload speed was close to .5-1.0 mbps upload speed in the house. This would be fine, but we weren’t told about this when booking.\n\nThere was some natural wear and tear on the house that took away from the luxurious experience. Nothing totally out of the norm though for a house used for this purpose. All in all, it was a great experience for a smaller group with a unique and stunning ambiance!",

    "summary": "The Hygge [pronounced, Hoo-Gah] is the NEWEST build from the Box Hop team (Emily & Seth Britt). We spent OVER a year planning all the details and jumping through every hoop to make this 5x bedroom container home happen. We used three 40' containers and four 20' containers for the Hygge Box Hop which has 4x PRIVATE balconies and over 1,200 sqft of outdoor patio space. \r\nThe interior is decked out with a Scandinavian décor and has a 6x person Sauna and a Hot Tub located on the covered deck. \r\nWe are BEYOND excited to share this vision with you and hope to have the honor of hosting you in one of our spaces.",
    "notes": "To note: during the winter months, the cabin may be difficult to access due to weather on the driveway. It will be plowed, and maintained after each winter storm, but during those months an all-wheel drive or 4-wheel drive vehicle is recommended.\r\n\r\nGuests may cancel for a full refund minus approximately 4% taken out for Paypal fees until 5 days before check-in. If the reservation is canceled after that, the guest is entitled to a 50% refund if canceled 24 hours prior to the beginning of the reservation. Within 24 hours of the confirmed reservation, if the guest cancels their stay, there is no refund.",

There are also several local shops, restaurants, breweries, scenic tours and the John Glenn Astronomy Park.",

The place was very nice and it had what we needed for the stay. It does not come with an oven and therefore we brought our airfryer. The floors in the bathroom were heated which was a nice touch. The place was dark during the night and early morning. The garage door was sealed and kept any light and outside elements from coming in. We really enjoyed the space.",

If you are staying in the dead of summer, it can feel like a sauna at first, but truly does cool down very quickly.  \n\nThe highlight for us, though, was all the animals!  Getting to wake up to roosters crowing and cows peeking at you though the back window, seeing (our name for him) Big Hoss the pig strutting out to the pasture and the little piglets running about was awesome.  The farm cats causing mischief on the roof was a nice cap for the evening, too.   If you want rural feel while still being close enough to town, definitely stay here!",

If you’re hoping to spend some time there (beyond a quick overnight), perhaps wait until the weather is cooler unless some changes are made. The bath house is cute but has poor ventilation. Even with the AC on, it was hot inside at night and didn’t have a screen if you wanted to open the door. The AC in the sleeping space worked great and the space was well kept. For the price, it would be helpful to have some basic supplies (oil, salt, pepper, pan, etc.) on hand so guests don’t have to bring their own. Offering firewood as an add on—purchase on site, would also be helpful. I enjoy being, camping, and cooking outside. Cooking/eating outside was in direct sunlight, so it was toasty / had to cover up even in the morning. The birds, flowers, and mist were lovely to wake up to. Thank you for having us!",

We ended up booking after another airbnb host cancelled our reservation in a booking mix-up but we ended up\nbeing grateful our original booking fell through as this was surprisingly awesome.  The pictures almost don’t do justice to how close you are to the river and what the view is like. Kayaking was so fun and easy. You can kayak for 20 minute and hop off at a local bar for a drink.\n\nIf you want a bit of an adrenaline rush, check out Noah’s Lost Ark, an exotic animal rescue where you get pretty up close to some crazy animals (Siberian tigers, baboons, leopards, lions, bears, etc…)\n\nAll in all it was a great trip. Hosts were friendly and responsive, our door code wasn’t working but they were quick to respond and help us get in.",

I do also enjoy an occasional city experience where I can walk from place to place. Which is simply, coffee shops and cocktail bars. When the road trip bug bites, Air B n B is my first go-to, and have always had the best experiences! ",

It was above our expectations of what a container house should look like. We enjoyed ourselves so much. Thank you Kathy for making our anniversary trip so memorable.",

Do not be fooled by the small footprint of this amazing container home...Kathy has expertly maximized the efficiency of this space with everything you need for a comfortable living space. The outdoor deck area is the perfect extension of the indoor space. The way the door faces the wooded area makes this place so relaxing and quiet. I absolutely loved this space--it was hard to leave. I'd highly recommend bringing some pre-made meals or easy to heat food so you don't have to drive too far to find somewhere to eat and you can spend more time relaxing in this amazing space!",

While it is based on a shipping container, the space is utilized superbly, very nice furniture and finishes and comfortable and spacious feel. Also, beautifully integrated deck and trees. Very peaceful and beautiful surroundings. Home well stocked and very clean, making it a pleasant stay. To top it off, we had a great visit by super friendly chocolate lab, Baker, and an orange tabby, Simba, who hung around on a porch with us for bit. Highly recommended for a quick pit stop or a longer stay near Kidron. Thank you Kathy (and Baker and Simba), best wishes!",

    "summary": "The Trailer Park at Empire Yard offers a unique perspective of downtown Macon living. This shipping container home not only offers a quirky, fun atmosphere but also puts you within walking distance of the most popular downtown destinations. But why stop there? You will also have panoramic views of the downtown skyline, swimming pool with tanning shelf, wrap around deck, outdoor fireplace, and even a Tesla charging station! Whether in town for business or pleasure the Trailer Park can't be beat.",
    "space": "This shipping container home makes up the top container only. This space consists of a full size bed, let out sofa, and option of pack-n-play. Great space for a couple or small family. This is an open concept and does not have a door for the bedroom.",
    "access": "This container home is part of a high end Loft complex. You will have access to gated parking (one car only), pool, outdoor fireplace, both gas and electric grill, and dog area. The complex is home to 28 residents so you will never feel \"crowded\" anywhere. The pool is usually empty unless it is a weekend during June, July, or August when a few residents may be around. \n\nIf in town for business or if you need an office space you will have access to a separate space in the bottom container that will be private.",
    "notes": "We value security at this property and the entire complex is monitored by camera and owner is 10 minutes away in case any issue arises.",
    "neighborhood": "The Trailer Park is in the heart of Macon's Historic Railroad Industrial District. From Coal and Rail yards to Millwork shops and grocery stores if it was made in Macon it was probably made in this district. Macon's original cemetery is located down the street and one of the original Millwork shops, Willingham Sash & Door,  is still in operation one street over. Empire Yard was once a Coal yard, Ice House, and later, an Ice Cream facility.",
    "transit": "Sixth street offers free street side parking. You may walk to restaurants and venues downtown via the Poplar street tunnel or drive the short distance. Downtown does charge to park with a maximum of 3hrs. Central City Park and Luther Williams field is a 15 minute walk (0.8 miles). The Welcome center for Macon, Visit Macon,  is located 0.5 miles away at 450 MLK Jr Blvd. where many tours may be booked.",
    "interaction": "Owner is available for any questions or problems throughout stay and may be reached by phone or through app.",
    "house_rules": "Children under 14 years of age must be accompanied by an adult in the pool area as well as by an active fire at outdoor fireplace. \n\nGuest must pick up after their pets in the dog park located at rear of property.",

We watched and listened to the songs of all kinds of birds in the trees and on the lower deck during the day and we were serenaded by the tree frogs while we enjoyed the hot tub and screened porch in the evening. The internet isn’t made for multiple devices to stream at once, but this isn’t that kind of vacation spot! Don’t get me wrong, we streamed peaceful music when we wanted, and even streamed a few shows, but we napped, we chatted, we read, we spent time together. The perfect spot for our anniversary trip!",

We have stayed at a lot of cabins for our anniversaries and this was hands down the best experience we’ve had. Peaceful, unique and so so private. You often feel like the rest of the world has disappeared. The Italian place she recommended had incredible pizza and cheesesteaks and the La Naranja had incredible Mexican food. The flatbed grill on the deck was easy to use and made stellar breakfast and burgers. There’s a speaker that you can Bluetooth your tunes to and I’ve never heard a small speaker have such fantastic bass response. And don’t get me started on the cigar and bourbon bar in the cabin. Sarah knows how to create an Airbnb! I would not hesitate to recommend this cabin ever! I want to go back in the fall to experience it with some cooler weather.",

The Maintenance staff was very hospitable, and again, the man makes the hot tub “Sparkle”, which a lot of places mention they have, but are not usable.\n\nAs long as you work with RentX for any arising issues or questions, they are ontop of their game, accommodate, and resolve issues ASAP. \n\nThe surroundings were perfect, the lake water was fantastic, and the fire pit was great. \n\nThe house is definitely an experience, and a conversation piece. It can also host,accommodate, and entertain anything you throw at it. \n\nDefinitely, this is a good family experience a place, and worthy of enjoyment. Including the support\nAnd host",

    "summary": "Calendar for 2022 & 2023  is up to date. Please subscribe to our mailing list to be notified of cancellations and other Box Hop happenings: www.theboxhop.com \n\nThe Overlook Box Hop - is our newest build by the Box Hop team (Emily & Seth Britt). The name speaks for itself, as it \"Overlooks\" the beautiful rolling acres of Hocking Hills, Ohio. Using four 40 foot shipping containers, we have transformed and recycled these once cargo containers into an experience in and of itself. \n\nThe interior is a transitional design that will make you feel right at home. The kitchen flows right into the dining and open living space, perfect for entertaining. \n\nThe Overlook features 3 bedrooms (one a bunk room perfect for kids), 1.5 baths, and a hot tub. It is enough space to host 7-8 people. \n\nLastly, it's worth noting that the property is a total of 75 acres, home to 2 waterfalls and a plethora of hiking possibilities right on site. \n\nWe are SO thrilled to share the newest Box Hop, the Overlook, with you and we cannot wait to host you. \n\nXo  - \nThe Britt's",
    "notes": "Guests may cancel for a full refund minus approximately 4% taken out for Paypal fees until 5 days before check-in. If the reservation is canceled after that, the guest is entitled to a 50% refund if canceled 24 hours prior to the beginning of the reservation. Within 24 hours of the confirmed reservation, if the guest cancels their stay, there is no refund.\n\nPlease note: The house does have WiFi,  however, due to the secluded setting of the property, we are limited to satellite service which can be finicky, especially in inclement weather. We normally test at speeds of 15 MB down and 2 MB up which is within zooms requirements",

    "summary": "Water front cottage with the best long range mountain views on the lake.\n\nCozy 2 bedroom home (800 sq ft) with open floor plan that has a large fantastic deck and swimming dock for your get away. This beautiful 100 acre lake is nestled in the mountains of South Carolina and is a perfect base camp for just relaxing or adventuring.",
    "space": "The space is open with lots of light and feels like your staying in a tree house above the water. Open floor plan allows for the space to feel much bigger than it is.  We have provided updated modern furnishings that will allow our guests to hopefully feel at home. The house sits at the end of the road and is in a very quite wooded area. Wifi and a 40 inch Smart TV are available when not enjoying the lake or all of the nearby recreational opportunities.",
    "notes": "Things to know..... \n\nBecause we are in the mountains and the house sits up high on a hill there is a short down hill walk to the dock along a narrow trail. \n\nHome is on a septic and will clog if anything other than toilet paper is flushed. No wipes of any kind. \n\nAn outdoor security camera is present. No cameras indoors. \n\nWell behaved pets are ok with an additional 40$ pet fee per pet. No more than 2 pets in the house. We ask that pets please stay off furniture and not be left alone in the house. Pets must stay on leash when outside and not roam the neighborhood. \n\nWhile the HOA lake rules do not allow outside watercraft (boats, kayaks etc) we do allow guests to use our paddle boards. Please read the lake rules concerning floating on the lake and wear a life jacket found in the dock box. \n\nAll trash must be in bags. We pay for a private company to pick up garbage. They do so by hand and will not pick loose trash in the bin. \n\nThere is no Washer or Dryer or Dishwasher available. \n\nMore details on the house and area can be found in the house manual.",

In 1998, we fell in love with the space and opportunities we saw in Canada, specifically in the Niagara region.\n\nWe own and operate Prins Grow Inc, specializing in cut flowers since 1998. We have been blessed with two girls (Sarah and Fay). Over the years, as we grew together as a family, we saw the need for Inn the Orchard, a place where couples could celebrate and a space where business could benefit from a fresh air perspective -a farm stay that offers rest and inspiration for both body and mind. \n\nIn 2019, we expanded into the hospitality industry opening Inn the Orchard. Our 17 acre property, is nestled among Niagara’s fruit trees and grapevines, sitting on the shores of 16 Mile Creek.",

Unfortunately, the home was tilted slightly and we had to be careful descending the stairs. This was not mentioned before, like the fruit flies.\nIt was nice to be surrounded by peach trees and others. Unfortunately, we were never able to get close to the ripened fruits at the back of the main house, due to their semi-guard dog. It was a little scary since I had been bitten by a dog as a child.\nDespite instructions about there being a basket for fruit picking, there was no basket in the home and after texting the owner as to where it is or what to do, we were told that the basket was simply in the barn. We were not given directions as to where or what the barn looked like. There were some nearby unidentified fruit on trees but after inquiring by text, we  did not receive an answer as to what they were.",

The place was clean and had everything we needed plus the grey kitty was a bonus! We fed him every morning and gave him lots of love. I will add that it can be a bit noisy since there are train tracks a street over from the container and it’s not in the nicest area of Wilmington but it definitely served its purpose and is about a 5 minute drive to Historic Downtown Wilmington and Riverfront Park. I never felt unsafe staying here and Reid and Jamie were very helpful and responsive when we had some issues with the lock on the front door. Thanks for the cool and unique stay!",

We roasted marshmallows, sat around the fire pit and  drank the wonderful wine the the hosts left for us. Mike and Reggie were fantastic,  couldn’t ask for better hospitality. They made it clear that if we needed anything at all, or had any issues to let them know and they would be right on top of it. They had everything there that we needed. We took advantage of all the fun things outside and spent several hours in the hot tub! We enjoyed our two nights there so much, I wish we had a few more nights. It was fun, relaxing and romantic, this will definitely be our go to place anytime we are in Charlotte. Thank you Mike and Reggie 🙏🙏",

We had a great time on the lake, fishing on the dock and kayaking.\nThe home had everything we needed, and it was great to have access to kayaks, fishing poles, firewood, etc.\nLuke’s dad lives on property and was very helpful and friendly.\nWhen we had bad storms come through and lost power for several hours. Luke’s dad came right away in the middle of the storm and got a generator hooked up to be sure we weren’t without power.\nI would definitely recommend this place for getaway in the woods on a peaceful lake.\nOne thing that would have been nice is more substantial outdoor seating, since there’s obviously not much space inside to sit!\nThere is a picnic table and some plastic chairs on the small patio out front, but it would have been nice to have a better table and chairs.\nAlso of note - it’s not easy getting up to the beds and not enough space to sit up straight. We managed fine but it was tricky!",

It's a unique experience rich with both contemporary art and vintage thoughts throughout. \nThe home itself was inviting and comfortable. I enjoyed the art, decor, and movement of light throughout the home. The view of mature oak trees, moss, and moonlight was lovely\nThe downstairs space has 2 bedrooms and 1 bath. The upstairs bedroom and bathroom are quite large and attached to an office/workout space with 2 couches. I would have preferred true beds in the upstairs space as I thought the description was 4 bedrooms/5 beds. I know my family would have liked doors upstairs for privacy (especially the toilet).\nThank you.",

It's a unique experience rich with both contemporary art and vintage thoughts throughout. \nThe home itself was inviting and comfortable. I enjoyed the art, decor, and movement of light throughout the home. The view of mature oak trees, moss, and moonlight was lovely\nThe downstairs space has 2 bedrooms and 1 bath. The upstairs bedroom and bathroom are quite large and attached to an office/workout space with 2 couches. I would have preferred true beds in the upstairs space as I thought the description was 4 bedrooms/5 beds. I know my family would have liked doors upstairs for privacy (especially the toilet).\nThank you.",

If you aren’t the most camping-savvy person this stay could pose a few challenges (learning how to build a fire, remembering to heat up your shower water ahead of time, etc.) but Porter was always responsive and ready to lend us a hand! Once we figured things out, our stay was fabulous and totally worthwhile. Would definitely visit again especially in cooler months",

Porter and co. have done an amazing job of turning shipping containers into tiny little off-grid cabins, and also of tailoring the off-grid experience to work for those (like us!) who're used to city living :-). Lots to do in the little towns nearby, but also a great place to just get away from the world. Would absolutely stay there again!",

    "summary": "*Click on our logo image to book another cabin on our property. Our 4-season 40-foot container cabin is set on a stream and 20 acres of mountainside wilderness. Warm in the winter and cool in the summer...gaze at the stars from the deck, enjoy the Solo fire ring, yoga platform, DIY wood-fired hot tub and hammock. The cabin is two hours north of NYC, with 110v power, propane and wood heat and a compost toilet. Woodstock, Kingston, the Hudson River and hiking trails are 15 min away.",
    "space": "**Click on our logo image to book another cabin on our property.\n\n\"One of the best Airbnb cabins we’ve rounded up from all across the U.S.\" - Architectural Digest, 2022\n\n\"Top 12 Airbnbs in the Catskills\" - Time Out, 2018-2023\n\nWe took everything we learned building our 20-foot container cabins and incorporated it into our deluxe 40-foot container cabin. The 40-footer is a \"high cube\" container, with 9' 6\" ceilings, household 110v electricity, a dedicated bedroom (with a door and room for a crib or luggage), indoor bathroom with shower, EVERGREEN STITCHES organic percale linens, and a beautiful deck overlooking it's own waterfall and stream. It is not like other tiny home compounds in the area that have dozens of units set 10 feet away from one another. It sits on its own stunning 5-acre parcel in the middle of an old-growth forest, slate ledges, a stream and resident owls and deer.\n\nThe cabin is toasty in the winter with a propane Rinnai heater—in addition to the wood stove. There is a hammock and an adjacent promontory with a second fire ring and seating. The wood-fired hot tub is very DIY, but amazing once you get it going. The bathroom has a compost toilet and a shower. The sitting area in the cabin is elevated with an L-shaped Ikea Friheten sofa (bedroom has a traditional bed) opposite two contiguous 5'x5' windows to stare at the forest and wildlife. The writing desk is an original Mohonk House secretary. The sofa converts into a queen-size sofa bed, that we often leave out for maximum-lounging space.\n\nStaying in a 4-season container cabin is not like living in a house or a hotel room or a glamping tent. It is like living in the wild, except you are encased in high-efficiency insulated walls with giant low-energy windows—and sleeping on a comfortable bed. You can watch shooting stars from the living room. You will likely see a family of deer wandering through the woods while you make coffee. If it's cold outside (with the direct vent propane heater and wood stove it's always warm inside) we usually fire up the sauna and lounge around drinking coffee. (You can book multiple 120-minute private sauna sessions.) If it's warm, we leave the double doors open and lounge around the patio.\n\nLiving in a container cabin is kind of like living on a boat in the middle of the woods. Our inspiration was to create an immersive wilderness experience with the comforts of home. There is solar power in the 40-footer with outlets throughout the cabin. The heater has a thermostat—set it and forget it. The bathroom is tiled and located inside the cabin. The wood stove has a glass door with ceramic baffles, reburners and a blower for maximum heat. High-efficiency insulated walls and low-energy windows keep the cabin warm in the winter and cool in the summer. There is a refrigerator with a freezer box. The bedroom is like a nature capsule with a 7'x7' picture window at the foot of the bed and a 7'x8' sliding glass door on the south wall.\n\nStaying in the cabin is an experience, not a simple overnight. On a 20-degree night in the middle of a blizzard, it is 80 degrees and silent inside. There are enough pots/pans/kitchen tools to cook whatever you want. (Yes, we have a coffee grinder.) There is a gas grill and a two burner propane cooktop in the kitchen. In the summer, a breeze off the 3,645-foot mountain behind us keeps the container cool, and the sound of the waterfall will put you to sleep.\n\nThe cabin is cleaned immaculately after every stay, now using CDC disinfecting standards. It is set on a truly gorgeous 20-acre plot on the eastern edge of the Catskill Mountains. It feels a bit like Maine, or Alaska. You can't see any neighbors from our property, but there are neighbors, great ones. (Please be courteous and respectful to them.) We are on the side of Kaaterskill High Peak and have tons of wildlife on the property. (Listen for the barred owls at night!)\n\nAll guests are left with 15 gallons of filtered potable drinking water. (The sink uses a foot pump.) There are drawers under the bed for clothes, room in the bedroom for a crib or pack-and-play, and a mudroom for jackets, shoes and backpacks. No smoking inside, please, plenty of room to smoke on the deck outside...\n\nWe have a cell signal booster in the cabin, so service is good. The other 20-foot containers are divided by driveways and each are private. (We designed it that way.)\n\nSaugerties is a gem. Miss Lucy's (dinner), The Dutch (drinks), Circle W General Store (breakfast/lunch) Love Bites (breakfast) and Diamond Mills (fancy!). Walking to the lighthouse is a must, as is hiking to Kaaterskill Falls, Huckleberry Point and North and South Lakes. Hunter Mountain is also 30 minutes away. Food shopping and farm stands are 10-15 min away.",
    "access": "You have the entire property on your side of the driveway. Streams, woods, cliffs and marsh.",
    "notes": "The shower is a simple battery-operated camping shower that you fill with hot water. (Heat it on the stove.) Toilet is a compost toilet, simple and clean.",
    "neighborhood": "We are 15 minutes from Saugerties, Woodstock, Kingston, Catskill and the Hudson River. We are about 500 yards from Kaaterskill Wild Forest and 3,645-foot Kaaterskill High Peak. West Saugerties is rural, full of farms, horse properties and the high peaks of the eastern Catskills.",
    "transit": "Parking is ten feet from the cabin. Buses to Saugerties are an option, but we highly recommend bringing a vehicle.",
    "interaction": "We or our caretakers are available all of the time. Just give a buzz and we can help out.",

    "summary": "This is one of 4 cabins on the property. We are an adults-only venue except for special Family Weeks. View the images to see kid-friendly dates.\n\nYou will stay in an upcycled shipping container that is nested in an old-growth forest perched 70’ above Perry Lake. New in 2022, the premium interior feels fresh and modern. Visiting the horses, bird watching, and hiking are guests' favorites.\n\nThis cabin has been carefully placed to offer a private, 360-degree view of the surrounding wilderness.",
    "space": "Your cabin is an upcycled shipping container. Brand new in 2022, its clever design is stocked with goodies like heated towel bars, quartz countertops, and fast Wi-Fi. Huge, fixed windows make it feel light and modern (but don’t worry… there are shades in case you need a break from all that nature!). Around you is a mix of open horse pastures, densely wooded trails, and a natural lakefront. \n\nStillwater Stables also hosts a revolving art show; guests will find their cabins filled with original art from local artists that is available for sale.",
    "access": "Guests can enjoy the trails that wind throughout the property and can access the lake via our new dock. There’s also a paddle boat available to use during the summer.",
    "notes": "Your cabin is tucked into the woods! It gets dark and the footing can be tricky so try to check in during daylight hours. If this is not possible, let us know and we will assist you.",
    "neighborhood": "As I bet you can imagine - our farm is located in a rural area! Expect to drive about 2 miles along a dirt road before you arrive at the turn into our driveway, which is almost a quarter mile long.",
    "transit": "Your car will be the best way to explore the area. \n\nAlso, we have a private ride service provider (a former Uber and Lyft driver) that services the farm. Please request that information after booking.",
    "interaction": "We live on the property so you'll likely see us around! We are happy to greet you, share time with the horses, or answer any questions you have, but otherwise expect to have a very quiet and private experience.",
    "house_rules": "Special Events and Commercial Use:\n\nFor extra guests, special events, or commercial use - please reach out to us while booking to discuss your plans. Additional fees, permits, or accommodations might be required. \n\nNeutral Scent Policy:\n\nWe aim to provide a scent-neutral environment to ensure that each guest experiences a healthy, comfortable, and enjoyable stay. Please respect the next visitor by not using heavy perfumes, medicinal oils, cannabis, or air fresheners.  Burning, vaporizing, smoking, diffusing, or cooking anything that can be detected in the air or on the fabrics after your departure could violate this policy and you may be charged up to a $250 restoration fee.",

Tony was very responsive & made sure all of our needs were met! The listing states there are neighbors close by but it was never a problem for us, it felt like a little quiet community! The deck was our favorite part & where we spent the majority of our time. The only gripe I have is the walking distance to the river. Not to far at all I was just hoping for a path straight through the woods instead of up & around! Overall a very good spot 10/10 recommend & will be back!",

The hot tub was clean and we spent a lot of time relaxing in it. \n\nThe cabin is right next to a popular drop off on Shenandoah. We should have taken that as a hint, drop off. We brought an inflatable kayak and attempted to paddle around the access and quickly realized that was not possible. My husband did a 3 hour, 7 mile paddle and I picked him up across from downriver canoe company. He had a great time and I had some alone time too! . \n\nWe had a great night out in Luray. We went to dinner at watch and warrant (delicious food) and checked out the local, small, quaint theater and we had a wonderful time. \n\nTony, the host was extremely helpful and texted daily to see if we needed anything. We hope to come back one day!",

    "summary": "River Edge is a modern tiny cabin located directly on the Shenandoah River and just minutes from the national park – the perfect location for your getaway in the mountains.  \n\nThe highlights:\n - Relax in the outdoor hot tub!\n - Swim, fish, or go tubing on the river – just steps from your front door\n - Grill & relax with a glass of wine on the deck\n - Cook s’mores around the fire pit\n - Drive 15 mins to Luray Caverns or into Shenandoah National Park\n\nEnjoy!",
    "space": "Our modern, beautifully-designed tiny cabin has all the comforts of home, just nestled away in the Shenandoah mountains.  River Edge is packed with amenities and fun for couples or a special personal retreat – and is the perfect home base for your getaway!\n\nThe cabin includes:\n- High-quality pullout queen sofa bed (it’s very comfortable and large)\n- Fully-stocked kitchen with fridge, microwave, and two-burner hot plate\n- Central heat and AC to keep you comfortable, no matter the weather\n\nOutside, you’ll also find:\n- A large hot tub, perfect for relaxing after a long day exploring\n- Outside fire pit with seating for the whole gang\n- EV charging station\n- Kayaks, canoes, tubes, paddles – all located right on the river for you to enjoy\n\nBut the best part about the cabin is its location:  River Edge is located directly on a 1,200 foot section of the Shenandoah River.  When it’s warm, it’s perfect for swimming, tubing, canoeing, and kayaking.  We have canoes, kayaks, and tubes for you to use too!  There’s also great fishing (we’ve caught bass and channel catfish).  And at night, we love dozing off listening to the sound of the river rushing by.\n\nNote:  River Edge is part of a large private retreat, with two other cabins on the property – another tiny cabin about 50 feet from River Edge, and another larger cabin about 150 feet away.  You will likely see guests at the other cabins, and they may also be enjoying the river (and kayaks/canoes/tubes) during your stay.  That said, the property is very large – so you should easily be able to find a quiet spot on the river to call your own.  And of course you’ll have your own personal hot tub, and fire pit. The cabin has an EV (Electronic Vehicle) charger that you may use during your stay. There is an additional charge of $15 per stay. Please let us know if you would like to add this to your stay.\n\n(By the way, the other two cabins sleep 2 and 5 people each, respectively – so if you’re looking to book a stay with a larger group, please contact us.  Between River Edge and the other two cabins, we can accommodate up to 9 people on the entire property.)\n\nLastly, beyond the cabin itself, we love how close we are to downtown Luray and the famous Luray Caverns – both just a 10-minute drive away.  Beyond the caves (which we recommend you definitely check out), the town has fantastic breweries, restaurants, and shops for you to enjoy!  And of course, you’re also just minutes from Shenandoah National Park – with amazing hiking trails and views!",

Its a shipping container so its obviously not very big, so its clear she put a lot of thought into how she laid everything out in there because the flow was top notch. Gigantic shower. Very clean and well stocked kitchen. Adorable outdoor area. I wouldnt knock stars off for this but we thought it was 2 beds from the listing and theres only one, BUT I didnt check to see if the couch was a pull out or not so that could easily be my fault. \nMichelle was also super responsive, gave clear instructions and was very accommodating. She even let me check in early and have guests over for the afternoon because we all had flights canceled. \nUbers are really hard to get and take a long time (again nothing to do with her) so the recommendations she gave us about where to go and eat etc were really helpful. All in all loved my stay and would stay again if I was back in the area!",

And it is very peaceful and quiet- perfect to relax at the end of the day.\n\nCarrie has a number of great recommendations for restaurants, coffee shops and taprooms. Or just wander around in town and do your own investigations. And Carrie’s enthusiasm for Western North Carolina and Mini is infectious.\n\nMini does have a few quirks, as it is a Tiny home, but follow the instructions provided and all will be well.\nEnjoy!",

I would highly recommend staying at Mini, and we might even try to stay at Mac in the future with our kids (Mac is a little bigger than Mini). Mini was located right between Black Mountain and Boone so we had plenty to do. I 100% agree that Carrie is a super host!",

I love hosting and am so grateful for my amazing guests! \n\nBy booking mini you agree to adhere to check in and out times, duration of stay, cancellation policy, and all the following guidelines - please read them in full to be certain mini is a good fit for you! \n\n2 adult guests maximum/no exceptions - no unregistered guests on the premises at any time during your stay. no pets, infants, or children. \n\nNo third party bookings as they are against ABB's terms of service.\n\nI require a picture ID on file with Airbnb - just as a hotel does. ID's can be uploaded to your profile.\n\n*Please note that I do adhere to my cancellation policy with no exceptions. If your credit card does not offer it, travel insurance is highly recommended, it is inexpensive and so worth it! Airbnb now offers travel insurance! For as little as $25, your trip can be covered! The website insuremytrip dot com is also a great resource! (if a cancellation resulted in a booking by a new guest, I would absolutely refund the original booker, but this is not always the case.)* \n\nAbsolutely no food/coffee grounds etc.  - nothing but non solidifying liquids are to go down the drains, the sink will back up and require a service call from a plumber at guest's expense. All waste must be disposed of in the garbage. This is also very important bc mini is on a delicate septic system. \n\nNothing but toilet paper can be flushed! No \"flushable\" wipes, kleenex, dental floss etc. - strictly TP. This will keep you, me and her septic happy and healthy!    :D\n\nFor a variety of reasons, electric griddles for cooking in mini are not allowed. \n\nNo vaping or smoking in or on the premises.\n\nmini is not a party house, she is very square!  :D\n\nPlease note a cleaning fee is not in lieu of guests keeping the space reasonably clean. \n\nI do not accept pets and my guests w allergies expect to arrive to a dander free place. My neighbors right next door have two cute tinies and accept dogs! The cabins are called Bitty and Itty Bitty and it is dog heaven over there!\n\nThank you a million, have a fantastic time and come back!",

Being at the back of the property, I had privacy and could easily walk to the garden, barn, or porch of the main house if I wanted to look around or use WiFi. I loved the garden area and the animals. Greg and Trudy have created quite a little paradise. They are so welcoming and clearly great humans.  I definitely plan to return! Do yourself a favor and spend some time here. You'll return to your daily grind renewed and refreshed.",

Canopied by beautiful mossy oak trees, we enjoyed just relaxing and reading in the hammock there and then could go inside the cabin when we were ready to enjoy the air conditioning. We brought most of our food precooked or simple meals easy to warm up. There's no microwave just the grill with one range. We loved the fresh farm eggs Trudy gave us to use! The cabin had everything we needed. Be aware there are no electrical outlets. They use power banks for the lights and solar power for everything else. Super simple and eco friendly in addition to beauty and comfort. I loved it! The farm was a delight to enjoy and Trudy and Gregg made us feel so welcome but also provided us privacy as well. My favorite by far was feeding the horses!! So bring your big bag of carrots and handsome Jett will gobble them right up! lol! We will definitely be back!",

Everything was eco friendly and peaceful. All the places to stay are nice and shady. There is lemongrass everywhere. This is a wonderful bug repellant. \n\nMy wife and I took advantage of the jacuzzi under a beautiful oak tree. the oak tree had Spanish moss and lights hanging. This element gave it a whimsical/ romantic feel.\n\nThe location of Kokomo is near all the springs in north Florida. We took a cold dip in them and admired the beauty, went back to Kokomo and enjoyed a nice hot shower.\n\nWe are both ready to go back. Thank you friends, for a wonderful stay! See you soon!",

The house was very clean, with everything you needed. The hosts were very helpful and responsive, we even landed a late check out so we could enjoy one last morning. We had a party of 8 and the house suited us perfectly. 2 adults, 6 teenagers and a lab. Will definitely be returning!!! We had planned going into the gorge each day, but only ended up going to Jump Rock… plenty for the kids to do, right there at the property. The hike up to sunset point was an added bonus…. Don’t be fooled though, it is a tough one. The creeks were enough to keep the kids entertained all weekend. It was an awesome weekend at The Wilds.",

When searching for the location, using car directions on G-maps will definitely assist you (When using the walk directions, it took me down an adjacent road that didn't have a clear pathway to the Airbnb). The unit is located on a small dirt road that passes by 2 small houses. The shipping container was a neat experience and it provided all the essentials necessary for a comfortable stay.\n\nOne thing to note is that walking around at night might be a bit intimidating due to the condition of some nearby houses needing some care.

Le tout était d’une propreté immaculée, j’aurais pu croire être la première à m’y installer. La cuisine est bien équipée pour préparer des repas simples, un BBQ se trouve sur le deck. La salle de bain est spacieuse pour un petit logement avec une grande douche d’eau douce et un puissant jet. Le lit prend pratiquement tout l’espace de la chambre mais une armoire dans la salle de bain peut servir à ranger quelques vêtements. Il est agréable d’y dormir au son des vagues. La salon à une grande fenêtre face au fauteuil qui offre une vue spectaculaire de l’océan. Le grand deck est vraiment un bonus; grandes chaises, foyer, mobilier pour manger et le hot tub, le tout face à la mer ! Accès à la plage à quelques pas, idéale pour la marche matinale. Tout le nécessaire à quelque minutes en voiture; épicerie, pharmacie, liquor store. Comfort pour 1 , 2 personnes",

    "summary": "Adventure and nature seekers know that after a day spent on the road, trail or water, you're looking for more than just a place to crash. Camp Cabernet is central to all sorts of activities, yet provides a moment to unwind in nature and make unforgettable memories. Our charming farm suite is just that wilderness escape, with the amenities you desire from home. Enjoy a visit to our onsite winery + cidery, sit out on the deck + star gaze, or cozy up around the fire pit.",
    "space": "Enjoy all that Norfolk County and wine country has to offer! This quaint country-living oasis is a great place to get away, unwind, and enjoy peaceful rural living - while at the same time being only a minute away from the nearby towns of Port Dover + Simcoe, picturesque beach villages of Turkey Point or Long Point, and quaint Port Rowan.\n\nThe cozy solar-powered space is open-concept with a queen bed and small kitchen — perfect for chilling some local wine, or making a cozy breakfast with some farm fresh eggs! Fall into a blissful sleep to the peaceful country sounds of the crickets and the breezes, and enjoy stunning sunrises and sunsets all year. The kitchen includes a mini fridge + sink, with plates/bowls, glasses/mugs, cutlery, cookware + utensils.\n\nTry some of the nearby restaurants for a taste of Norfolk, or grab some steaks or sausages and grill them on the Napolean BBQ (with side burner) to enjoy a quiet outdoor meal cooked on your own schedule. \n\nA picnic table is supplied so you can enjoy al fresco meal and there's a fire pit for relaxing under the stars. An outhouse-style portable washroom is located next to the unit tucked beside an outdoor warm water shower (seasonal, not available once the ground freezes.) This washroom has no plumbing and is not a flush toilet.\n\nSince this suite is located at the back of the farm, wifi is not available - there is cellular service depending on your provider. Unplug and unwind. \n\nFront Road Cellars + Inasphere Wines are within a stone's throw, and many other wineries are within a short drive. If you're more of a brewery buff, the lovely Charlotteville Brewing or Hometown Brew Co are nearby, with lots of local brews to try!\n\nThe location is also ideal if you’re interested in a quick round of golf at Pine Valley Golf Course or spending the day fishing on Lake Erie. Book a spa day at Elements Day Spa, see a show at the Lighthouse Theatre, stop and shop at one of the region's antique shops, or explore even more of the eco-adventures nearby, like ziplining, mountain biking or birding.",
    "access": "The tiny house is located at the rear of the farm property, about .75 km from the main winery building. Guests will have the hilltop around the tiny house to themselves, where they can make a fire,  lounge on the private deck, or go for a walk in the woods. \n\nYou'll have your privacy, but please note, it's not a secluded location — this is a fully-functioned family farm. You will see us driving tractors, maintaining the crop and otherwise running our business. Please be mindful of your surroundings when walking/driving around the farm. \n\nThe space is designed with lots of natural light and unique décor to make you feel right at home in this adorable tiny home that was made with comfy weekend getaways in mind!",
    "notes": "The rural location guarantees there will be insects and other wildlife around and possibly indoors, especially if you leave the doors open. There are sounds of wildlife, domestic animals, and other farm noises. \n\nThe access to the cabin is driving up a gravel laneway, there may be sticks/branches/twigs on the route. The parking area is grassy, but can get muddy in heavy rain. \n\nThere is a portable air conditioner with ice blocks supplied. You may need to rotate these with frozen ones (supplied in mini fridge) to keep the temperature down in the extreme heat. In the cooler seasons, we do have a wall heater available.",
    "neighborhood": "Front Road is home to three wineries and a brewery, with others a short drive away. There is a convenience store with beer and wine outlet around the corner. Turkey Point is a short 7-min drive away from the cabin. There is a beautiful sandy beach, a handful of restaurants, hiking + biking trails and golf course. Port Rowan is a 7-min drive away, with quaint shops, a weekly farmers market and grocery, beer and liquor store. Port Dover is a leisurely 20-min drive with more shops, another beautiful beach, plentiful restaurants and our local theatre.",
    "transit": "The cabin is located down a gravel pathway, 3/4 km past the main farm buildings through the blueberry patch. There may be branches from the plants, puddles from rain, farm equipment driving or staff working enroute to the cabin. The parking area is grassy, but may be muddy on rainy days.",
    "interaction": "We work on site every day + live across the road. We will respect your privacy, but this is a fully-functioning farm.",
    "house_rules": "Any damage to persons and/or personal property while visiting is the responsibility of the guest(s). This is a fully functioning farm with insects, wildlife + hazards.",

Lots of wildlife and the view was amazing.\nSuper clean, well thought out, and welcoming special touches!!\nHosts were very helpful, friendly and informative.\nHOT TUB AND SAUNA… need I say more.\nWe left super refreshed!",

    "summary": "This is one of 4 cabins on the property. We are an adults-only venue except for special Family Weeks. View the images to see kid-friendly dates.\n\nYou will stay in an upcycled shipping container that is nested in an old-growth forest perched 70’ above Perry Lake. New in 2022, the premium interior feels fresh and modern. Visiting the horses, bird watching, and hiking are guests' favorites.\n\nThis cabin has been carefully placed to offer a private, 360-degree view of the surrounding wilderness.",
    "space": "Your cabin is an upcycled shipping container. Brand new in 2022, its clever design is stocked with goodies like heated towel bars, quartz countertops, and fast WiFi. Huge, fixed windows make it feel light and modern (but don’t worry… there are shades in case you need a break from all that nature!). Around you is a mix of open horse pastures, densely wooded trails, and a natural lakefront. \n\nThis cabin is nearby other units but has been carefully placed to offer a private, 360-degree view of the surrounding wilderness.\n\nStillwater Stables also hosts a revolving art show; guests will find their cabins filled with original art from local artists that is available for sale.",
    "access": "Guests can enjoy the trails that wind throughout the property and can access the lake via our new dock. There’s also a paddle boat available to use.",
    "notes": "Your cabin is tucked into the woods! It gets dark and the footing can be tricky so please check in during daylight hours. If this is not possible, let us know and we will assist you.",
    "neighborhood": "As I bet you can imagine - our farm is located in a rural area! Expect to drive about 2 miles along a dirt road before you arrive at the turn into our driveway, which is almost a quarter mile long.",

Additional fees, permits, or accommodations might be required. \n\nRead This Before Entering the Hot Tub:\n\nThe detergents, oils, and chemicals found in body lotions, deodorants, and makeup will clog the spa filters and foul the water so you must remove these before entering. If special cleaning is needed to restore the spa water after your stay, then a materials fee of $75 will be assessed along with any additional costs resulting from issuing refunds or cancellations to the guests who are scheduled to arrive after you (and who will not be able to use the hot tub due to this servicing).\n\nNeutral Scent Policy:\n\nWe aim to provide a scent-neutral environment to ensure that each guest experiences a healthy, comfortable, and enjoyable stay. Please respect the next visitor by not using heavy perfumes, medicinal oils, cannabis, or air fresheners.  Burning, vaporizing, smoking, diffusing, or cooking anything that can be detected in the air or on the fabrics after your departure could violate this policy and you may be charged up to a $250 restoration fee.",

He went above and beyond multiple times to make sure our stay was perfect. It's rare to find such a dedicated host.\n\nAfter searching extensively, this Airbnb is by far the best we've ever encountered. We had an unforgettable experience and even got engaged during our stay - this place has a magical touch! It's truly a slice of paradise.\n\nIf you're considering staying here, don't hesitate any longer. Trust me, you won't regret it. We highly recommend extending your stay if possible, as leaving was the only downside.\n\nThank you, Nick, for an unforgettable stay! We're already planning our return to relive those blissful moments.",

  "description": {
    "summary": "Stay at one of the most unique and stunning vacation rentals in the Smoky Mountains! The \"Appalachian Container Cabin\" is a modern tiny home with an unparalleled view overlooking the Appalachian Trail, built out of shipping containers, and was recently featured on the new HGTV/DIY show \"Containables\".  The cabin is located at the end of private road deep within the Nantahala National Forest, but located conveniently between Franklin, North Carolina and Clayton, Georgia.",
    "space": "The interior of this modern cabin is thoughtfully designed and includes one queen bed and three bunk beds. It's well designed for a couple with small kids. If you have more than one couple, the sleeping space will be the limiting factor. An additional person could sleep comfortably on the couch or you could camp outside on the deck or by the firepit.\n\nThe View - There are a lot of beautiful places in the Appalachian mountains, but one of the most amazing views is just out your back door.  You can watch a thunderstorm roll through over the Appalachian trail in the distance, enjoy a blazing sunset after dinner, gaze at the Milky Way and brilliant stars at night, roast marshmallows by the fire or enjoy a hike through our 100 year hardwood forest on top of our mountain.",
    "access": "Guests have access to the top 40' container and all outdoor deck space.  Guests do not have access to the two bottom 20' containers.",
    "notes": "We now have high speed internet, thank you Starlink!\n\nThe kitchen has the following amenities: Microwave, Toaster Oven, Keurig Coffee Maker, Regular Coffee Maker, Assorted Pots and Pans, 2 Burner Electric Cooktop Stove, Dishwasher, and a Full Size Refrigerator. The kitchen does not have an Oven.  We have a Blue Rhino Razor Black 4-Burner Liquid Propane Gas Griddle Grill which is perfect for cooking up breakfast or dinner on the deck.\n\nA detailed cabin guide will be provided the week of your stay. It includes directions to the cabin as well as a recommendations on where to eat, adventures to check out and ideas on where to shop.",
    "neighborhood": "Everything you need is close by - including grocery stores, farmers markets, great restaurants such as the Dillard House, and micro-breweries such as Lazy Hiker.  If you are here to hike, check out Pickens Nose or Albert Mountain.  The Pickens Nose trailhead is only an 8.1 mile drive from the cabin.  \n\nIf you are looking for a nearby adventure, explore Black Rock Mountain State Park, Tallulah Gorge State Park or a waterfall.  There are 7 waterfalls within a 45 minutes drive from our cabin to explore!  We recommend Dry Falls, Bridal Falls and Big Laurel Falls.\n\nAfter you are done hiking and visiting waterfalls, check out the Lazy Hiker Brewery.  It’s one of our favorite spots around to grab a drink, catch up with friends and meet locals.  All the beers are named after famous hikes around the area.  \n\nFor food, there are a lot of Farmers Markets nearby, but our favorite is Osage Farms. Try some Georgia Peaches or get the Apple Cinnamon Donuts (you have to get there early for them, they sell out quick). \n\nFinally, if you are interested in shopping, check out Culpepper's Otto Depot.  You’ll see this huge train depot building about 2 miles from our cabin.  It’s a unique architectural salvage business and definitely worth stopping in to.",
    "transit": "Although not absolutely required, we (highly) recommend a vehicle with 4-wheel drive.  The cabin is located at the top of a steep gravel road.",
    "interaction": "You can call me at anytime, text, or direct message if you have questions.",
    "house_rules": "4wd or all wheel drive vehicle highly recommended.  Prior to leaving, please wash dirty dishes and take your trash with you.  You can deposit your trash at the Otto Recycling Center located at 2877 Addington Bridge Road, Franklin, NC.",

The kitchen is a dream, the beds comfy, & the bathroom pretty darn spacious for a tiny house! We enjoyed making s'mores at the pitfire & just relaxing in the peaceful surroundings--it's a great, quiet location that feels rural, but is within a few miles of shopping, restaurants, & entertainment options if that's what you're seeking.",

Ashley & Dustin’s place is wonderful, AND we had no idea we’d be staying in a famous tiny house! 😉 \n\nThe only downside was the air did not work and sleeping in a loft with no air was not fun. The ceiling fan gave its best valiant effort, though!",

The house has everything you need and everything that you did not realize you needed. My husband and I enjoyed a quick getaway and we were able to relax right away upon arrival. The host even left us a sweet basket of goodies to enjoy while we were there! We really enjoyed the well stocked coffee bar to get the day started and the games in the basement. Absolutely would love to stay again!",
