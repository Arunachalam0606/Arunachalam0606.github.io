Feeding the turtles and fish from the porch was my favorite! Food is provided to feed them. The view in the morning and night of the sun on the water was such a beautiful sight as we drank our coffee/glass of wine. Although the cottage sits right on the water, you can hardly feel swaying. Boat rentals discounted too! The kitchen was fully equipped and had a full-size fridge, oven, and even a dishwasher!  Also, Cabana Live was open, which is a short walk right in the marina. It is an amazing bar, with delicious food,  tons of tvs and a pool! We had a great time there and even received a discount on drinks and food because we were in the cottage. Connie's deli is another awesome spot right up the ramp with delicious breakfast and lunch.  Kim was an amazing host who made our stay very special. Thank you!! We will definitely return!!",

That’s not always the case!), had the adequate necessities for our visit, and the location and view were unbeatable! \n\nFor a small, local beach, check out Matapeake Clubhouse and Beach, just a short drive away!!  Locals say it gets packed on the weekends (because it is so small), but was perfect during the middle of the week! \n\nFor the dessert-lovers:  the Reese’s peanut butter pie from Fisherman’s Crab Deck is TO DIE FOR!!  Bring quarters to feed the ducks in the pond corn from a dispenser right out front! \n\nQuite possibly the most relaxing vacation I’ve ever had, and I cannot wait to return!!! \n\nKirby is incredibly responsive, polite, and helpful….  Excellent host!  Highly recommend everything about Cass-N-Reel!!",

  "description": {
    "summary": "Immerse yourself in nature on picturesque Lake Fontana, nestled in the backcountry of the Great Smoky Mountains, when you stay in this unique floating tiny home. An ideal stay for adventurous water lovers!\n\nThis stationary houseboat is accessible only by boat, & provides guests the opportunity to fish & swim right off the front porch. Guests are provided with a canoe in order to travel back & forth from Fontana Marina (where guests park, and can also find wifi, snacks, drinks, etc) to the house.",
    "space": "This unique tiny house features a 225sqft interior with approximately 500sqft of exterior dock space. \nBeing a tiny home, it is truly best suited for 2 guests as a time, although it can sleep up to 4.\nThe primary sleeping space is a queen bed \"nook,\" with alternative sleeping options in the living room area being a twin-sized daybed + trundle pullout. The interior layout follows an \"open concept\" design (please note there are no true doors separating rooms). The bathroom includes a marine toilet, sink, and full shower. The kitchen features a gas stove, fridge & top freezer, small blender, basic cookware (pots, pans, baking tins & trays, utensils), dishes (plates, bowls, glasses, silverware), and a french press for coffee (instructions provided).\nOutside on the docks, guests can enjoy 2 cushioned lounge chairs, a dining area, a propane grill, and 2 swinging hammock chairs. There is a ladder provided for swimming access, as well as fishing poles. Guests are responsible for obtaining an NC fishing license & lures/bait, if desired.\n\nThis is an off-grid solar-powered house, so guests are advised to think of it as an \"upscale glamping\" experience (re: please leave the hair styling tools, coffee makers, and any other high-draw electrical items behind. This is not the same as a \"normal\" house or hotel. Be sure to ask if you have any concern about bringing a particular item).",
    "access": "Guests will be provided a canoe upon arrival at Fontana Marina if they do not have their own boat to access the house with. Guests with their own boat can use the ramp at the marina to launch, and are able to keep their boat docked at the house. It is a 3 min boat ride or 15 min paddle from Fontana Marina to the house. Parking at the marina is free.\n\nNearby amenities include Fontana Village Resort (1.5 miles up the road from marina), where guests can dine at 2 restaurants, play mini-golf, rent bikes, hike, get gas, visit the general store, etc. Guests are welcome to rent a pontoon, fishing boat, kayaks, SUP paddle boards, and more at Fontana Marina. There is also a historic lake tour most days. Fontana Dam (a .5 mile drive or 1.5 mile hike from the marina) is the tallest dam east of the Rockies. The Great Smoky Mountains National Park features countless trails, with Hazel & Eagle Creek trail access points being a short boat ride away from the house.\n\nGuests are encouraged to enjoy all areas in and outside the house- but NOT underneath it. It is very dangerous to swim underneath the house or docks. Swimmers can easily be knocked unconscious when the house & docks move in unpredictable ways due to boat wake and weather. Children are especially drawn to this, as it can seem like a great \"hide and seek\" idea while playing in the water. Parents should always be paying close attention to children in the water, but this is especially true while they swim around the house for this reason.",
    "notes": "There is NO WIFI at the house. This is a great chance to \"unplug\" & enjoy the sights and sounds this beautiful area has to offer. :) If you have Verizon, there is a limited amount of cell service. Otherwise, guests can head over to Fontana Marina (3 min boat ride, 15 min paddle) for free wifi access. \n\nThere is NO A/C. Keeping the windows & doors open allows a cooling breeze to pass through the house most days. There is a box fan provided if the breeze needs a little help. Cooling off in the water is the best & most authentic way to enjoy this stay!\n\nThis floating house is suspended over roughly 80-100ft of water. It is not accessible by land in any way, and you cannot stand up in the water. All guests MUST be strong swimmers, or wear a life jacket at all times while outside on the dock. \n\nThe house is secured in place by a 10,000lbs anchor block, as well as tethered off to land by rope in 2 places. As all floating structures do, it will move around some depending on weather conditions and boat traffic. Guests can rest assured it is perfectly safe in storms, and the marina is just 'a hop & a skip' away if guests ever feel in any way uncomfortable with the movement.\n\nThis home is connected to a city water line, and thus has clean potable water for drinking/cooking/showering/etc. All black & grey water goes into a holding tank. Please be conscious of water usage at all times (keep showers to a 5 minute limit) to avoid filling up the tank prematurely. Again, think \"glamping.\"\n\nSolar panels provide all power. If you use high-draw tools or appliances like a hair dryer or coffee maker, you WILL run out of power. Kindly leave such things at home. Charging phones/cameras & using the lights is no problem. \n\nPlease note that some facets of this home may be inherently challenging for folks with balance or mobility issues. The queen bed, for example, can only be entered at the foot, as the sides of the mattress are flush with the wall (i.e. one must crawl into bed). The bathroom is a relatively small space, without a lot of \"wiggle room.\" Good balance will be needed when stepping on and off the dock onto a boat or canoe. The house will noticeably \"rock\" when boats pass by. Please know your own limits and make a fair determination whether this stay is truly right & safe for you.",
    "transit": "If you don't have a boat, a canoe will be provided. There are also hourly/daily watercraft rentals (pontoons, bass fishing boats, paddle boards, kayaks, etc) available at Fontana Village Marina.",
    "interaction": "We live just across the harbor in another floating cabin. We would be happy to come do a walk-through of the house with you upon arrival to ensure you feel comfortable with the off-grid systems, marine toilet etc. We can be reached via phone should you have any issues (remember, no WIFI at the house so you will need to go to the marina to reach out unless you have Verizon as your provider), or message in a bottle of course. ;) We hope you enjoy your stay & we trust it will be an unforgettably beautiful experience!",
    "house_rules": "-Guests MUST sign a liability waiver (emailed after booking).\n-NO swimming underneath the house/docks. It is very dangerous.\n-NO hair dryers, curling irons, straighteners, coffee makers, etc.\n-Children under the age of 12 MUST wear a life jacket at all times when outside the floating cabin (i.e. on the dock, on boats, etc).\n-The 4-guest limit is STRICT (& will already be very tight). \n-Have fun!!!!",

While everything you needed was in this beautiful two-story house, the surrounding area provided you with fantastic eateries and plenty of activities to get involved with, both day and night.\n\nOne of the surprising secrets was the lively downtown sector, full of chic restaurants, unique stores and other rare finds.  You will be pleasantly surprised by all of the things you will be able to do during your stay, be it relaxing on the upstairs deck over the water or walking the streets of downtown.\n\nAgain, this was a 5 star experience and Marcia was the ultimate host!  Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to a stay on this fabulous boat house.  Just don't make  the mistake I did–stay longer than 3 days because you will not want to leave!",

    "summary": "Welcome to The Cove, Wilmington's most unique vacation rental community. \n\nFloating atop the Cape Fear River, our houseboats offer an experience unlike any you've had before. \n\nFrom the gentle rocking of the river, to the peaceful view of the sunset, your stay at The Cove is sure to leave you feeling refreshed, restored, and wanting to return again soon.\n\n*Please note: Decor differs from current pictures, but is equally as beautiful. Updated pictures coming soon!",
    "space": "After parking in our free lot and making the 4 minute stroll down onto the docks of the Port City Marina, you’ll arrive at The Cove, Riverwalk Villas. Secured with dock ties and connected to electricity and water, you'll quickly realize that a stay at our houseboat community offers the perfect mix of adventure, luxury and relaxation.\n\nUpon entering your houseboat, you’ll notice the spacious open concept kitchen/dining/living area and think to yourself, \"I should have brought more friends!\" (Don't worry, there's always next time.) \n\nCooking & Eating:\nWith a dining table that seats four, three benches along the island, and a kitchen stocked with everything you need to make a great meal, you could actually host your next Thanksgiving here. Complementary coffee, creamer and sugar are provided, alongside a drip coffee maker.\n\nLiving Room 1:\nIf cooking isn't your idea of fun, you may be more drawn to the beautifully decorated downstairs living space, where you can relax on the cozy couch surrounded by tall windows that overlook the Marina. \n\nBathroom 1:\nJust past the common area is the first floor bathroom, which features a walk-in shower and full size washer and dryer. Complementary shampoo, conditioner and body wash are provided in each of the bathrooms, as well as laundry pods, dryer sheets, hair dryer and a steamer. \n\nBedroom 1 (Queen):\nConnected by a pocket door is the downstairs bedroom with a Queen bed, large closet, ceiling fan, 40\" Smart TV, and access door to the quaint back patio; a great spot for some quiet reading or alone time.\n\nLiving Room 2 (Sofa bed):\nAs you make your way upstairs, you'll discover another large living space with a sectional couch (with pull out sleeper), 60\" Smart TV, desk and chair, and a beautiful view of the Cape Fear River through the sliding glass doors. \n\nUpstairs Patio:\nJust outside those doors, you'll find yourself on a large patio featuring an outdoor bar (sink & mini fridge), and a variety of comfortable furniture options. This patio is a fan favorite for everything from morning coffee, afternoon reading, evening spirits, or enjoying a meal. In the Summer months, you'll often hear live music coming from Marina Grill, our delicious on-site restaurant, or Live Oak Bank Pavilion Amphitheater, which is only a block away.\n\nBedroom 2 (King):\nBack inside and beyond the living room is the second floor bedroom, featuring a King bed, dresser, large closet, ceiling fan & 55\" Smart TV. \n\nBathroom 2:\nThe pocket door connects you from the bedroom to the second floor full bath, featuring another walk-in shower. \n\nLocation:\n\nThe Cove is located in Port City Marina, which sits on the North end of the Riverwalk in Downtown Wilmington. Just a few steps from the Wilmington Convention Center and one block from both The Wilson Center, and Live Nation's Live Oak Bank Pavilion Amphitheater, a stay at The Cove offers the perfect solution for those wanting to avoid the chaos of parking, event traffic, and needing a DD.\n\nLess than a mile away you'll find the heart of Historic Downtown Wilmington. Whether you choose to stroll along the Riverwalk, take the free trolley, or drive a few blocks down Water Street, getting there is easy. With many local shops, restaurants, breweries, live music, and events, Downtown offers something for everyone to enjoy. Check out our Guidebook or \"Wilmington and Beaches\" online for recommendations and events.\n\nBeyond the borders of Downtown, a quick 8 minute drive or Uber ride will get you to the Wilmington International Airport (ILM), and within a 10 mile radius you'll find Wrightsville Beach, Jungle Rapids amusement/water park, UNCW (Go Seahawks!) and much more.\n\nIf you're interested in bringing your boat, our friends at Port City Marina would love to rent you a slip! Please reach out to them directly to coordinate that for the dates of your stay.\n\nIf this houseboat is not available during your preferred time frame, please check out the listings for our other houseboats at The Cove, and don't hesitate to reach out for assistance. We would love to have you Stay Afloat!",
    "access": "Guests will have access to the entire villa for the duration of their stay.",
    "neighborhood": "Port City Marina (PCM) is a gated, full-service, deep water marina featuring over 200 state-of-the-art floating concrete wet slips. Uniquely located on the Cape Fear River, PCM hosts everything from transient boaters to our permanent houseboat community. \n\nThough currently scattered among the docks, we are watching with excitement as our custom built permanent dock is being constructed. This dock will host all 40 houseboats and will feature angled slips, beautiful landscaping, and a community space at the end of the dock.",
    "transit": "Free parking is provided for one vehicle per villa. Our parking lot is located about 1,000 feet (4 min walk) from the Marina, so we recommend packing in suitcases with wheels if you have them, and bringing an umbrella or rain jacket. \n\nIf you will have more than one car, you can park in one of the two paid parking garages located diagonally from our parking lot.

We went in august so it was hot there are 2 portable ACs on the houseboat  lt never really got cold but after cooling down it was comfortable. The bathroom never really cooled down and there is a smell because your on a houseboat. We had a fun mother daughter trip! Oh and kayaks and paddle boards are complementary so that was nice! Overall a good experience!",

Morning coffee while watching the sun rise, snacks after a long day on the beach, and cocktails while the sun set = my kind of vacay. Andrew and the entire team was so helpful with getting the jet ski, paddleboard, and bike rentals. We enjoyed the slight rocking of the boat and did not get sea sick at all. Highly recommend!",

We’ve been married for 11 years, and currently have three furbabies. Sonny is a Merchant Marine and I am a Realtor, so after selling a gym we owned for 6 years, we needed a new focus… enter our little Houseboat! We absolutely love to travel and explore new places. We’ve always enjoyed the hotel feel and we’re looking forward to providing that experience for our guests, and hopefully make some new friends along the way! ",

    "access": "To access the property, guests will unlock and enter remotely using the FLOHOM guest app to unlock the smart keybox.",
    "notes": "(1) FLOHOM's gentle movement or sway in response to the currents and winds is part of the unique experience we offer. It allows you to truly go with the flow and immerse yourself in the tranquil rhythm of the water. Our houseboats are thoughtfully designed to ensure stability and minimize excessive movement. Many guests find the gentle sway adds to the charm and relaxation, but if you have a history of motion sickness, we recommend considering your comfort level beforehand.\n\n(2) To ensure a peaceful and respectful environment for all guests and the neighboring liveaboards, quiet hours are from 10pm-7am, which are strictly enforced. Your FLOHOM is noise monitored by indoor and outdoor noise awareness sensors, which will monitor the decibel levels on the vessel but are not active listening or recording devices.\n\n(3) At this time, pets are not allowed. We plan to allow our furry friends in the future.\n\n(4) FLOHOM is designed with the needs and preferences of adults in mind, and as such, it's not the best fit for families with young children. Children 10 and older are allowed. Our goal is to create a peaceful and relaxing environment that adults best enjoy, and we believe that by setting an age limit, we can ensure that our guests have the best possible experience during their stay.",
    "neighborhood": "Welcome to the vibrant and historic neighborhoods of Federal Hill and Inner Harbor, two of Baltimore, Maryland’s most iconic areas, each offering a distinct taste of the city’s rich culture and heritage.\n\nFederal Hill, set on the South Baltimore peninsula, is a treasure trove of American history. A walk through its tree-lined streets is akin to stepping back into the 19th century, with the boasting stunning period architecture. As the heart of this neighborhood is Federal Hill Park, a lush hilltop haven offering panoramic views of the Baltimore skyline and the neighboring Inner Harbor. \n\nThis community is buzzing with life, hosting a collection of trendy bars, boutiques, art galleries, and eclectic restaurants. Make sure to visit Cross Street Market, a modern reincarnation of the historical marketplace, where local vendors serve a diverse menu of culinary delights. \n\nOn the other side of the water sits the Inner Harbor, the city’s primary entertainment and tourism hubspot. The waterside community features attractions such as the National Aquarium, Maryland Science Center, and the USS Constellation. Stroll along the scenic promenade to encounter lively street performances, or take to the water in a paddleboat or Baltimore Water Taxi for picturesque city views. When the sun dips below the horizon, the Inner Harbor truly comes to life; its many restaurants, bars, and entertainment complex lights up the night.\n \nFederal Hill and Inner Harbor are well-connected, offering convenient public transportation options for exploring the wider city. But perhaps one of the standout features of these neighborhoods, especially for sports fans, is their proximity to Camden Yards and M&T Bank stadium, home to the Baltimore Orioles and Ravens. Within walking distance from the stadiums is FLOHOM 1 | Bay Escape, the ideal lodging option for any sports enthusiast. Imagine spending an exhilarating day cheering on your favorite team, then strolling back to your comfortable accommodations without the hassle of navigating traffic or searching for public transportation. \n\nWhether you’re a history enthusiast, foodie, sports fan, or just looking to immerse yourself in the local culture, choosing to stay at FLOHOM 1 | Bay Escape in the heart of Baltimore’s Federal Hill and Inner Harbor neighborhoods ensure a memorable experience filled with excitement, convenience, and comfort.",
    "transit": "Federal Hill and the Inner Harbor are ideally situated neighborhoods, enabling guests to access a wealth of attractions within walking distance. Yet, should you wish to broaden your Baltimore experience, numerous convenient transportation options are available. \n\nWe recommend utilizing rideshare services like Uber and Lyft to explore nearby neighborhoods or venturing slightly further. Alternatively, the city provides a greener option with electric scooters, such as Bird and Link, which can be found scattered throughout the neighborhoods. \n\nMaritime enthusiasts will love the Baltimore Water Taxi. This local service stops next to the Rusty Scupper Restaurant, adjacent to the Inner Harbor Marina. It’s not just a mode of transport but a scenic way to explore the city, providing routes to the other side of the Inner Harbor and several stops within the beautiful Baltimore harbor area. \n\nFor those flying in or out, the Baltimore Washington International (BWI) Airport is conveniently less than 20 minutes away by car. Washington, DC is less than an hour’s drive for day trips or onward journeys, or you can catch the MARC train for a more relaxed journey. At FLOHOM 1 | Bay Escape, you’ll find you’re at the heart of Baltimore’s vibrant neighborhoods and the hub of excellent transport connections.",

If all you want to do is stay on the boat, or go to the one bar/restaurant & pool that's at the marina, it's great. Otherwise there's absolutely nothing to do there in 90+ degree weather & nowhere close by either. We are in our 60's & found the floating dock & stairs to be very rickety & unsteady. And the hatch to the below deck accommodations was quite heavy & cumbersome. Also, it took a very long time for the air conditioner to cool things off.  Probably our fault, but it's really designed for younger people.",

    "summary": "This ferrocement boat was made in Sweden in 1973. That’s right! It’s made of concrete! The boat circumnavigated the globe twice before eventually ending up here in sunny Sanford FL. We spent 2 years completely renovating everything and tried to leave as much of the boat’s original personality intact while adding modern amenities. \nLaundry facilities, showers and restrooms, diner, and marina store all on site, and downtown historic Sanford and river walk close by.",
    "space": "This quirky, unique, relaxing, fun boat is one of a kind! Lounge on the sun deck, enjoy a frozen cocktail and lunch at the restaurant with a pool at the marina, or take a short trip to historic downtown Sanford. \nKeep an eye out for wildlife such as turtles, alligators, fish, tons of birds, and the occasional manatee!\nEverything you need is provided so you don’t have to worry about forgetting something. Just bring your clothes and enjoy your stay!",
    "notes": "Boat life is a little different than your everyday rental. Since it is in water the boat does move and rock slightly. \nThe marina is gated and a key will be locked in a lockbox so you can come and go as you please. I am 30 minutes from the marina if needed. Another thing to keep in mind is that things are a little smaller in a boat. It’s very similar to an RV, so smaller sinks, lower ceilings (5’10” at the lowest downstairs), and a smaller hot water heater. You can enjoy a shower for about 10 minutes. There are also shower facilities at the marina.",
    "neighborhood": "*Boat tree marina pool and bar is currently under construction due to hurricane damage** \n\nClose to downtown Historic Sanford (5 miles, 12 minute drive) that has tons of amazing restaurants in historic buildings, fun events like food truck festivals, brunches, a German festival, breweries, clubs and bars, live music, a river walk on the St John’s river that has beach vibes, a zoo where you can feed giraffes, and much much more.\nBlue springs State Park is a quick 30 minute drive and is famous for being the home to hundreds of manatees in the colder months. It’s definitely worth visiting. After a walk on a beautiful boardwalk seeing the manatees I recommend going to historic downtown Deland for lunch a d shopping.",
    "transit": "There is a parking lot at the marina for you to park. You can also easily use Uber or Lyft, there are 2 Sunrail (our local train) stations that connect to downtown Orlando, river cruises and airboat tours, local Sanford airport. There are also lots of bike and hiking trails nearby.",

With views of breathtaking sunrises, activities all summer, a community private hot tub for adults over 18, outdoor grilling areas and much, much more, this experience will be everything you’re looking for. Nestled in the new and completely remodeled SōlStay Retreat - Marina. More pictures to come!",
    "space": "This is a tiny houseboat located directly on Lake Erie. Each boat is unique. You will have to walk off the boat to use the restroom facilities and other amenities.",
    "access": "We encourage guests to enjoy the grilling area, the hot tub and other amenities on the property.\n\nThe hot tub is seasonal. It is available May - September.",
    "notes": "Please note that the restrooms are not in the unit. There is a high end restroom trailer with individual locking restrooms that have a toilet, shower and sink. These restrooms are shared with other guests on the property.\n\nThe hot tub is not shared with the public, but is shared among other guests on the property.\n\nPlease keep in mind, Lake Erie welcomes mayflies, spiders and other insects in the warmer months. This is something that we can not control, but will always take steps to prevent best we can.",
    "neighborhood": "Nestled on a small road just off Cedar Point road, we are situated in a very private secluded and safe little neighborhood.\n\nWe are about 1/2 mile from Cedar Point. There is a bar across the street and the Pipe Creek Wildlife area within walking distance with a great walking path and views!",
    "transit": "Getting around by car is best but we have many boating amenities on the property including paddle boards, tiki boats and many other boating rentals available. There is also a boat taxi that can bring you right up to the Cedar Point docks for a small fee.",

Welcoming committee was on hand when we arrived (the ducks) and the fishing was great. Also spent some time exploring the local area. You can't go wrong with a stay on the tugboat. Would love to spend more time next time.",

We had a wonderful stay at this property and really enjoyed all it had to offer. We had extended family stay at the other properties on the lake and got to spend quality family time together for several days. The kids ran free, going from swimming, to kayaking, to fishing, back to swimming! It was the perfect getaway!! We're all planning to come back next year!",

We haven't gone camping in a long time and this was glamping with a great access to water, fire pit, and comfortable indoor. Cooking on the fire was an adventure to get re-acquainted with and enjoyable. With enough Internet to get spotify playing our music on bluetooth speakers, a roaring fire lakeside, great drinks, food, company, we had a fabulous time in our getaway. We brought our dog. He was fine with it all and played in the water, walked the lake perimeter, and visited the animals. We did visit some local wineries, Lake Anna and the Luray caverns.",

Tug floats on an 8 acre private Lake w/ Island on 142 Wooded Acres, with 5+miles of hiking/biking trails.

    "space": "*Please read entire listing*\nOur goal is to provide a unique adventure for guests with all the conveniences of home.\nOur Custom Tugboat was brought all the way from Connecticut! Getting the boat in the water and put back together was it's own adventure! \nThe Tug is at the opposite side of the Lake from our home and our Log Cabin Listing. Guests can drive over the Dam to the other side of the lake where you can park (Paved road except last 1500' is gravel/dirt 4x4 is NOT required). From there you walk a short way through a beautiful wooded trail(1/10th of a mile or 500').\nWe provide a yard cart to help move luggage or we are happy to help deliver your luggage for you with our ATV.(Please let us know in advance if you will need help)\n\nInside The Tug Boat\nThere is a Galley/Kitchen with cooktop, microwave, coffee pot, full-size refrigerator w/ freezer, utensils and everything for your cooking needs. We do provide coffee, tea, sugar, flour, condiments(Ketchup, Mustard, Mayo) along with spices and cooking oils. \nThe main level:\nHas a lovely dining area with view of the lake and kitchen, there is a Double Bed located at the stern of the boat. There is a twin air mattress located in a drawer under the main level bed that can be blown up and placed in the dining area. A small full bathroom is also located on the main level of the boat with a full shower and flushing toilet. \n\nThe Pilot house/upper level:\nOffers 360 degree views of the Lake and Forest. Accessed from a ladder and trap door within the boat or from the outside stairs. There is a comfy seating area that transforms into a California King Bed. Enjoy your coffee or cocktails on a deck overlooking the water with the best views on the property. This is the spot for stargazing, with no light pollution whatsoever. \n\nThe Outdoor space:\nIs very well lit at night by twinkle lights(can be turned off) which makes for a very romantic setting. A beach area sits just outside the Tug to play, launch boats or slowly wade into the water. Kayaks are provided and trails are right outside your door that can be taken all the way around the lake and more! There is a large fire pit with a grate that swings over for grilling over wood or charcoal. We sell dry Firewood or you can help yourself to any fallen wood that you can find. \n\nThere is never a lifeguard on duty! Please use life vests and supervise children. By booking with us you agree to use the lake, trails, and property at your and your guests own risk.\nSwimming, or any other water play is at your own risk. You are accepting responsibility of yourself and other guests when having full use of the property, trail hikes, biking, swimming...etc.\n\nPlease use your best judgement when bringing children of all ages, if you are unsure about something please ask.  \nNo parties.  \nNo outside guests allowed.  \nNo motorized vehicles on trails or Lake\nNo jumping/diving off boat - SHALLOW water\n\n\nYou will most likely meet our golden-doodle Mabel while hiking. She is extremely friendly but please do let us know if she's a bother. She enjoys meeting new guests and their furry companions and is wonderful with kids! \n\nFAQ:\nWIFI? \nWifi is provided through Starlink, which typically works great for streaming movies, music and social media.\n\nAre Dogs allowed?\nWe are allowing dogs on a case by case basis. You may need to lift your dog in and out of the boat. There is a 2 step ladder down into the boat, some dogs jump in. We do charge a $125/ per pet fee that we charge in advance. The terrain is dirt/gravel so please wipe paws so we can keep the Tug beautiful and maintain our rental. Please do not allow dogs on the furniture. \n\nDoes the boat rock?\nYes, but not much under normal circumstances. Mostly just when someone is getting on or off.\n\nIs there Heat and A/C?\nYes, there is one window mounted A/C unit on each level and will be equipped with space heaters durning the cold months (It stays quite warm with little effort). Of course the boat will not regulate temperature as well as a home so please come prepared with warm and cold weather clothes.\n\nHow are the bugs?\nThe Tug boat is in the middle of the forest on a Lake, so yes there will be bugs, frogs, toads, and all that mother nature has to offer. Mosquitos are not bad at all, but bring bug spray anyway.\n\nCan you Swim in the Lake?\nYes, our family swims here on a regular basis. About 1/2 way to the island the water is much deeper and makes for a nice swimming spot.\n\nIs there a motor?\nNo, the boat cannot be moved around the Lake.\n\nIs it safe for kids?\nPlease note that while we have done our best to make the Tug safe for everyone, it may not be suitable for all young children. The boat is surrounded by water and forest with many entrances and exits. Please use your best judgement as parents.\n\nIs there running water?\nYes, there are 2- 50 Gallon tanks of water and a pump that turns on when you open a faucet. If you run out during your stay we can easily fill it back up! We fill a 1 Gallon Jug in the refrigerator for drinking. The water is potable but if you'd like to limit the use of water please bring more drinking water. We do provide marine safe/ biodegradable soap in the shower and at the kitchen sink. \n\nHow big are the doors?\nPlease see our pictures and info under accessibility. There is no standard size door to use, so please ensure you are comfortable with the small doors before booking. \n\nCan you jump off the boat?\nNO! The Tug is docked in 2-3' of water.\n\nIs there a grill?\nThe fire pit has a grate that swings over the fire for grilling over wood or charcoal! It is also the perfect setup for S'Mores! You may purchase wood from us and we provide lighters and grilling tools in the Tug. \n\nDo you need 4 wheel drive?\nNo, after our paved driveway the road turns to gravel and dirt. However, it is hard packed soil and gravel and fairly easy to manage for most cars. If you are concerned, you can park on the driveway and we will help you get to the boat.\n\nDoes boat make noise?\nYou will hear the bilge pumps occasionally test for resistance. They are located in the hull on the front and back of the boat and it sounds like a dull groan.\n\n*Please read all rules*\nOur family lives here and we have other listings on the property, please be courteous:) \nNo loud music as it disrupts the sounds of nature and possibly other guests. Noise does travel across the lake. \n\nThere is never a lifeguard on duty! Please use life vests and supervise children. By booking with us you agree to use the lake, trails, and property at your and your guests own risk.\nSwimming, Kayaking, SUP, or any other water play is at your own risk. You are accepting responsibility of yourself and other guests when having full use of the property, trail hikes, biking, fishing...etc.\n\nPlease use your best judgement when bringing children of all ages, if you are unsure about something please ask.\n\nNo parties.\n\nNo outside guests allowed.\n\nYou must be comfortable climbing a ladder to the loft.",
    "interaction": "Our family lives on the property at the opposite side of the lake. We are available at most times of the day and are typically here should you need anything during your stay. We are always happy to meet and chat with guests, but understand many guests come here for privacy. \nOur small farm has free range chickens, ducks, and rabbits as well as sheep and goats. We love sharing the animals with guests, please let us know if you would like to visit and feed them.",

The houseboat has a classic design, with a clean white exterior and large windows that let in plenty of natural light while offering picturesque views of the water.\n\nThe main living area of the houseboat is an open concept saloon, with a convertible dinette that can be transformed into an extra sleeping space if needed. The living area also includes a fully stocked longitudinal galley (a kitchen for your landlubbers), complete with a mini-fridge, propane stove/oven, and plenty of counter space for meal preparation.\n\nThe houseboat features two sleeping areas - one with a queen-sized futon bed and the other with a twin bed, providing plenty of space for up to four people to sleep comfortably. The head (bathroom) contains a separate stall shower with hot water, electric toilet, and all the amenities you need to feel at home.  The head is smaller than what you might be used too but is efficiently designed to make best use of the space available.\n\nStep outside onto either of two decks and you'll be greeted with stunning views of the waterway and the surrounding scenery.  Both decks are furnished with inviting seating that offers plenty of room for relaxation and entertainment. The upper deck is ideal for soaking up the sun, while the lower deck provides a shady retreat from the heat. Whether you're enjoying a cup of coffee in the morning, taking in a picturesque sunset, or stargazing at night, the decks provide the perfect spot to relax and unwind.",
    "notes": "In addition to its prime location on the water, our houseboat is also just a short drive away from some of the area's most popular attractions, including Hammocks Beach State Park and the vibrant beaches of Emerald Isle. With endless opportunities for outdoor adventure and relaxation right at your fingertips, this is truly the ultimate vacation destination.\n\nThe houseboat does not leave the dock.    Happy to help arrange a boat rental to get out and explore the local waters or a private charter with an experienced captain to help you find the best spots!",

The boat itself didn't feel tiny in any way and had everything we could think of needing. The stairs to the loft might pose a little problem for some, or for taking up luggage, but we were only there for 3 days, so we staged our clothes and backpacks in the downstairs mudroom so the stairs would be more manageable.  We visited Monday through Thursday and just a heads up, most of the shops and restaurants are closed on Monday. We found Henry's Depot to be one of the few spots open on Monday and were hugely surprised at the great choices. Will recommended the Hawaiian BBQ at Sweet and Salty and he was right!  My husband and I eat a plant based diet and from the research we had done of the restaurants before coming we didnt think we would find Vegan/Vegetarian options but we were wrong! The Huli Huli Tofu was incredible!!! LoJax had 3 choices for vegan pizzas.  Great town, great host, great stay!",

Would have been good to have a railing or something.  Everything else is perfect, just as shown on the website. St. John’s Steak and Seafood was excellent and within a short walk.",

There are a few downsides that could be reflected in the price per night: 1. There is very little air circulation and it was very hot in the houseboat. There is no shade on the boat - we did go during a heatwave but we could not spend our second night there. 2. This was very much “glamping” and all the amenities are such as what you’d use to camp so the price felt a bit high in that regard 3. The dock surrounding the boat is quite small so there wasn’t as much room to relax outside. 4. We loved swimming in the lake but getting out was a bit difficult as the beach didn’t seem as safe (ie saw a couple of snakes and it was quite rocky. Overall, I think improvements on some of these things could justify the price a bit more and enhance the experience :) thank you very much to the hosts!",

Getting out to the boat with the dingy was very easy and only took about 10 minutes. The boat launch you park at was only a ~5 minutes drive to St. Armand’s Circle with lots of great restaurants, bars, and shopping. We had great meals The Old Salty Dog and New Pass Grill and Bait Shop which are right down the road from the launch. We definitely recommend renting the paddle boards. We had manatees swim right up to us while we were on them! This was the best/most fun Airbnb we’ve ever booked. We had an amazing time and can’t wait to book again!",

One of the most unique airbnbs we have ever done. Really awesome to take a little dingy to the houseboat, which completely surrounded by water. Waking up on the water and grilling dinner watching the sunset at night was so relaxing. It felt like glamping on the water. We can’t wait to come back again soon. Do not hesitate to book this—it’s life changing!!!! Just do it!",

    "summary": "PLEASE READ THE ENTIRE LISTING BEFORE BOOKING. \nThe Floating Oasis is a 4 season houseboat, moored on the Sarasota Bay. This dream boat is designed by an architect with AC, shower, and electricity. There is a cozy full size bed and lounge chairs on the balcony for year round stays, bbq, and dry composite toilet on board.",
    "space": "The Floating Oasis is a 4 season (fully insulated) houseboat. The boat is 30ft long with 23ft of inside cabin space. The boat has a cozy bed with surrounding windows to watch the sunset and sunrise. The boat has two doors, the front door for the patio and access to the balcony and the back door for fresh air from the sea next to the bed. There is a full turf top deck, perfect for suntanning, star gazing, or yoga! The boat comes with 3 circular windows with netting to open for more fresh air without letting any bugs in and many more rustic features! \n\nThere are two 120v batteries and solar panels and a generator for electricity and AC on the boat. There are two USB charging ports connected to our solar system which you can use to charge your phones. THERE IS CELL SERVICE ON THE HOUSEBOAT. \n\nOn board is a dry composite toilet and a shower with hot water that lasts up to 5 minutes with maximum heat afterwards, the water is lukewarm and still bearable to shower. If you wait another hour or two there will be more hot water. \n\nThere is a lock on the boat from the outside if you need to leave to go to town. (It’s a very quiet and safe place). You can also lock it from the inside. \n\nTHE BOAT WILL BE MOORED AND GUESTS CANNOT DRIVE IT. \n\n\nWater shuttle: \nThis Floating Oasis is moored out in the bay away from land and can only be accessed by boat. We offer a 9-foot dinghy enough for two people and luggage. The dinghy is a powered boat to get you to and from the houseboat. You will be ferrying yourself to the houseboat in the dinghy, which is about a 10-15 min ride. Expect some wind and waves. We will meet at the ramp to check-in.\n\nThere is free overnight parking available at the boat ramp. \n\nThe boat is on the Sarasota Bay, great for paddle boarding and fishing. Dolphin sighting is almost guaranteed.\n\nWe supply:\n2 gallons of purified drinking water.\n(Bring more if you wish)\nCoffee and tea (no creamer) \nOil, salt, pepper, sugar and some spices. \nBBQ and utensils for BBQ.\n55 gallon Cooler (you may bring ice to store food)\nPlates, bowls, utensils, pans, cutting boards, cups and mugs.\nBiodegradable soap and shampoo.\nBug spray and sunscreen. \nRestroom essentials \nCleaning supplies\n\n\n\nPlease note:\nThis is not your typical stay. While efforts have been made to preserve the modern conveniences we’ve become accustomed to on land, some of them must be sacrificed while still other conveniences must be accepted. (Limited power and water, no wifi)\n\nAir conditioning is installed but is recommended to only be used if you intend to stay inside as it requires the generator to be running in order to be used, which is loud outside. Please keep in mind that it takes up to an hour of run time to bring the temperature down inside the boat once the AC has been started, depending on how hot it is outside. \n\nYou must bring food and drinks with you just like camping. \n\n\nSafety:\n-We provide 4 life jackets.\n-First aid kit.\n-Air horn and whistle.\n-Fire extinguisher\n-flashlights",
    "access": "Full access to the entire boat.",
    "interaction": "We are available to offer help throughout your stay and we can keep in touch either through Airbnb or if it’s an emergency you can call us as well.",

Will and Co-Host Lori run a private marina in a wonderful spot on the Ohio River.  The boat is absolutely amazing!!  There are two floors.  The upper floor has a small living room that leads outside to a deck.  The bottom floor has a great little kitchen where we made breakfast every morning.  Then a bathroom and bedroom.  The bed is very comfy and we both slept so well it was unbelievable.  There is a sitting area at the front of the boat where we hung out just taking in the scenery and other boats going by.  It is calm, peaceful, relaxing and so unusual!!  Not too mention...this is a working boat!!  Just to see the paddle wheel going is amazing!!  Will and Lori live on a nearby boat and in between is a common area that is under cover.  It has an ice maker and a grill is available for your use.  Will and Lori were awesome hosts!!  We def will be back!!!",

    "summary": "This is your opportunity to truly embrace living on the water! This remodeled house boat is the perfect way to make your next getaway unforgettable! Enjoy your floating private suite featuring an open concept kitchen living area, full bathroom,  beautiful 360 degree waterfront views, shade deck and roof top sun deck! Enjoy watching local watermen unload their morning catch around 2pm. Within walking distance of downtown and shopping! Central to all local attractions, in the heart of Cambridge!",
    "space": "The House boat is at 35 foot Catamaran Cruiser located in a small harbor with a mix of pleasure and work boats of waterman who are commercial fishing, crabbing, and oystering.  It is located next to the gated community of Deep Harbour.  Yes, this is how they spell it, which inspired the name of our boat, Harbour House!  The boat has everything you need to be comfortable and feel relaxed during your stay in Cambridge! There is AC and heat onboard! The boat will remain docked during your stay!\nThe Trenton Street Boat Dock is home to many local waterman and local boaters!    The boat is within walking distance to local seafood dining, shopping, and waterfront parks!\nOnly 5 minutes away from the Hyatt Regency Chesapeake Bay!\nCambridge is centrally located on the Eastern Shore of Maryland!  The perfect spot to stay if you want to explore the shore!  This is the perfect home base for Eastern Shore day trips to Kent Island, Easton, Tilghman Island, St Michaels, Ocean City, and Assateague!\nDorchester County is also the perfect place to go Eastern Shore \"Island Hopping\" and visit Hoopers, Taylors, Elliotts, Tilghman, and Kent Island for the weekend!",
    "access": "Guests have access to the entire house boat.  The boat will stay docked during your stay! (The house boat is very difficult to drive.  It is kind of like driving a tractor trailer when compare to road driving, LOL!)",
    "notes": "There is a xfinity/comcast wifi hot spot that can be accessed on the boat if you have an account!  There is a Ruku TV, so you can connect your own internet from your phone to the TV and watch any internet TV subscription that you have!  Or you can sit back and watch You Tube! There is also an old school antenna that gets three local channels!\nThe boat rises and falls with the tide!  When the tide is high the boat is nearly level with the dock!  When the tide is low you will have to take a big step down to the boat or use the ladder attached to the dock to lower yourself down the boat!  This is certainly unique to boat living!",
    "neighborhood": "The small harbor is located in downtown Cambridge next to a gated community.",
    "transit": "If you want to explore downtown Cambridge you can do so by foot or bike.  Of course you can also travel downtown or out of town via car.",
    "interaction": "Feel free to call, text or message through Airbnb.",

    "summary": "I have a 36 foot houseboat with gorgeous views of sunrises and sunsets on the Savannah River from the back deck and mid-deck. Downtown restaurants are within a quarter mile. Gated entry. Located in Augusta, Ga. Kitchen includes sink, toaster oven, microwave, mini fridge, utensils, coffee pot. Sit on the back deck and watch the river and boats go by, or front deck and watch the  bike and foot traffic. Two kayaks are available, with paddles and life jackets.\n\nAvailable for extended stay Dec-Feb",
    "space": "You can be in the boat and watch the river and boats go by or on the water in a kayak. A gas grill is on the back deck. River walk is a one mile pedestrian and bike trail there at the marina",
    "notes": "Bear in mind that a houseboat isn’t like a motel room. You have the amenities of a motel but on a reduced scale. You also have solitude and you’re surrounded by nature, along with a beautiful view and colorful sunsets and sunrises. If you want all the creature comforts, a houseboat might not be for you. If you want a unique experience this is where you need to be.",

Everything went exactly as Kimberly described and she even gave us a heads up about the festival that was going to be happening while we were there. The views were amazing! We did not care one bit about how much it rained this weekend. Note to folks who may get motion sickness - since the weather was bad when we got there the boat was rocking a little more than usual. Luckily I had a motion sickness patch and felt better very quickly. There were several restaurants within walking distance so we did not have to always drive to downtown Annapolis and fight for parking. Hands down, I would totally stay here again.",

    "summary": "This BRAND NEW condo house boat is nestled in Back Creek. The views of the Chesapeake Bay are amazing! This is the best place to see the sunrise from the roof top deck while sipping a cup of coffee. (Four guests maximum)",
    "space": "The houseboat is kept on a boat lift which is suspended above the water. Even though the houseboat is stationary on a lift, the boat does have some movement and will sway with wind.",
    "notes": "We do not allow pets or child under the age of 10 years old.\n\nCHECK-IN IS AFTER 4pm\n\nPlease note is you are looking for an early check-in prior to 4pm there's a $100.00 fee. An early check-in can not be guaranteed until 2 days prior to check in.",
    "house_rules": "Rules of the Houseboat\nDo your part to help keep our Houseboat clean, unique and enjoyable!\n\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION, PLEASE READ CAREFULLY!\n•\tPlease be respectful of our space & everything in it.\n\n•\tPlease be respectful of your neighbors.\n\n•\tParties are strictly prohibited.\n\n•\tRegistered guests only. Max of 4 people at all times. \n\n•\tIf you break, burn melt or destroy anything, don’t just throw it away. Please let us know so it can be replaced.\n\n•\tNO jumping, diving, or swimming off the boat or docks. \n\n•\tNO outdoor grilling on the boat. We do have grills available near the Bath House. \n\n•\tAfter each use please secure the 4 deck chairs on the top deck to the railings with bungees. We can get gusts of wind up to 35 mph or more so to protect yourself and others it is important to secure the chairs after each use. \n\n•\tHang wet bath towels on provided hooks, don’t leave them on the floor.\n\n•\tPlease keep in mind you are staying on a boat; the plumbing is quite different then a normal house. DO NOT flush anything besides waste! We know it is a different concept, but please discard toilet paper in the trash can opposed to flushing it. Every couple days the Marina staff will pump out the 100 gallon holding tank. (This is done at the stern of the boat with no disruption to you.) All water used on the boat, kitchen sink, bathroom sinks, showers and toilets is all captured in the 100 gallon tank, so please be mindful on the amount of water that is being used. Should you notice the sinks slow to drain contact the Marina Office so that we can pump out the holding tank. \n\n•\tThe TV’s have a HULU account available for your enjoyment. If you would like to access your own web-based TV account you are more than welcome to do so, just remember to sign out of your account prior to departure. \n\n•\tWe do have onsite coin operated washer and dryers in the Marina Bath House if you need to do laundry. If you need quarters, stop by the Marina Office. \n\n•\tBe sure to have a yellow hanging parking permit visible when parking in the Eastport Yacht Center’s parking lot. Vehicles without a parking permit will be booted at the owner’s expense.",

      "about": "HELLO There!!!  I moved to the Outer Banks from Ellicott City, MD in 2013.  I studied Human Nutrition, Foods & Exercise with an emphasis in Exercise and Health Promotion at Virginia Tech and put that knowledge to work on a daily basis as a Pilates Instructor at the only classical Pilates Studio in the OBX, The Presidio of Pilates!  In addition to my education, my love for business and entrepreneurial spirit led me to AirBNB!  I CoHost multiple spaces in locations throughout the United States and as a Professional Referrer of AirBNB I take great joy in teaching folks how to start their own business hosting by themselves or with assistance.  I have taught a course at the local church - The Path To Financial Freedom with AirBNB - I LOVE to TRAVEL - so reach out if you would like me to teach a course in YOUR home town in the US or Internationally!\n\nThings that bring me great joy:\n1. My relationships with my K9 Medusa, kitties Oli & BB, close friends & family, clients & guests!\n2. Water (referring to all large bodies of water....not the beverage! ;)\n3. Beach walks and Podcasts!\n4. Meditation\n5. Pilates\n6. Quotes!!\n\nAs an Air Ambassador, I am grateful for every guest, and potential new host, I correspond with! I look forward to hosting YOU, your loved ones, and many more in the months and years to come...truly a labor of love!  Should you need assistance in hosting your own property, I would be delighted to help you with that AS WELL!\n\nTravel quotes that inspire:\n\n~A good traveler has no fixed plans, and is not intent on arriving.\nLaozi\n\n~Once you have traveled, the voyage never ends, but is played out over and over again in the quietest chambers, that the mind can never break off from the journey.\nPat Conroy\n\n~All journeys have secret destinations of which the traveler is unaware.\nMartin Buber\n\n~Two roads diverged in a wood, and I -- I took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference.\nRobert Frost\n\n~Remember that happiness is a way of travel - not a destination.\nRoy M. Goodman\n\n~Own only what you can always carry with you: know languages, know countries, know people. Let your memory be your travel bag.\nAleksandr Solzhenitsyn\n\n~We are all travelers in the wilderness of this world, and the best we can find in our travels is an honest friend.\nRobert Louis Stevenson\n\n~Experience, travel — These are an education in themselves.\nEuripides\n\n~Little by little, one travels far.\nJ. R. R. Tolkien\n\n~Travel far enough you meet yourself! \nJoseph Campbell\n\n",

But for the price, there’s pretty much always something better to stay in at OBX. Of course, I knew it was a boat- I was thinking about more like Joe Manchin’s boat than my uncles boat. It was an ok stay- I’d stay there for free for sure. But the value was not a good one.",

Chief Manteo was, in fact, one of the first American residents to travel to Europe as an honored and distinguished guest.\n\nSurprisingly, this is not the most notable footnote of the town's history. Manteo is the home to one of the world's longest running historical mysteries, specifically, the disappearance of the Lost Colony. In 1597, after a series of surface explorations, including one commandeered by Sir Walter Raleigh himself, a new colony was sent to Roanoke Island to settle and begin the English expansion of the New World. Led by John White, the colonists arrived in Manteo and quickly set to building and creating a new settlement. In the process of building a new civilization, John White's own daughter gave birth to the country's first English child, Virginia Dare, for which the Outer Banks home county is named.\n\nMonths later, however, supplies had run short, and John White had to make a hesitant trip home to England to resupply the camp. Once in Europe, White found himself bogged down by both government inquires and bad weather, and it wasn't until 1590 that he was able to make the long voyage back to Manteo to bring help to his colony, his daughter, and his new granddaughter. Sadly, when he returned, he found the entire colony had been virtually wiped off the map, with only a minor clue to their fate carved into two neighboring trees: the words \"Cro\" and \"Croatan.\"\n\nMany modern historians take this as a sign that the colonists, either as a desperate move to escape starvation or outrun threats from neighboring Native Americans, relocated to the southern beaches of Hatteras Island, where the Croatan Native Americans thrived peacefully. However, after long coastline explorations, John White found no sign of his daughter, grandchild, or any other living soul of that first original Roanoke Island Colony.\n\nToday, the drama of the Lost Colony is honored in Manteo with, quite appropriately, an Outdoor Drama. \"The Lost Colony\" show is the nation's oldest running outdoor drama and features a prestigious cast of former players, including Andy Griffith who starred in the show for several years before becoming a star, and then later returned to the Outer Banks to live out his days as a happy, retired resident.\n\nThese days, the show is performed nightly in the summertime to sold-out crowds who enjoy the Broadway worthy singing, dancing, acting and pyrotechnics. Reservations are strongly recommended in the prime June, July, and August months as the legendary show, which also features a post-show meet and greet with the cast of characters, tends to sell out fast.\n\nThe area is also home to the majority of the county's local government offices and services, including the county courthouse, the DMV offices, and the administrative county offices. In addition, vacationers in Manteo will find everything from small grocery stores to pharmacies to bait and tackle shops, for any items they might need during their vacation.\n\nFor a day trip that's overflowing with the area's most treasured historical attractions, or a relaxing vacation that's off the beaten path, a trip to Manteo should definitely be on the Outer Banks agenda. Vacationers find that after a full day of exploring the shops, sites and attractions, there's still plenty left to see, as well as plenty to love, about this small town with a lot of coastal character.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhere is Manteo, NC?\n\nThe town of Manteo is located on Roanoke Island, which is sandwiched in between the central Outer Banks beaches and the eastern North Carolina mainland. It is bordered by the Roanoke Sound to the east, and the Croatan Sound to the west.\n\nHow do you get to Manteo, NC?\n\nVisitors from the western part of North Carolina or the Outer Banks can reach Manteo via US 64.\n\nWhat is there to do in Manteo, NC?\n\nManteo has one of the highest concentrations of attractions in the Outer Banks. These popular sites include the North Carolina Aquarium, the Elizabethan Gardens, Fort Raleigh National Historic Site, Roanoke Island Festival Park, the Lost Colony Outdoor Drama, the 1800s Island Farm, the Roanoke Island Marshes Light lighthouse, and the historic downtown area. The town also has a wide array of shops, restaurants, art galleries, historic homes, and other distinctive attractions.\n\nWhere did the name Manteo come from?\n\n“Manteo” is named after a Native American Croatan Chief who greeted and befriended the early English explorers of Roanoke Island in the 1580s. Manteo helped the first colonists survive their initial winter, and even traveled to England in 1584, and again in 1585.\n\nHow old is Manteo, NC?\n\nManteo is one of the oldest communities in the state of North Carolina, and the country. Founded and settled in the 1580s, the area was the site of the first English child born in America, Virginia Dare, as well as one of the first English settlements in the New World. Centuries later, Manteo would be named the seat of government for Dare County in 1870, and the town was officially incorporated in 1899.\n\nWhat is the Lost Colony?\n\nThe Lost Colony was one of the original colonies in the New World, and was settled in 1585 on Roanoke Island. Founded by Sir Walter Raleigh, the colony suffered from tensions with the nearby Native Americans, as well as a lack of food and supplies. As a result, the colony’s governor, Governor White, left the settlers behind in 1587 to sail to England and ask for help. When he returned in August, 1590, all 115 members of the colony had disappeared, and the only clue of their fate was the word \"CROATOAN\" scratched onto a post, and the letters “CRO” etched into a tree.\n\nWhat happened to the Lost Colony?\n\nThe fate of the 115 settlers of the 1580s Lost Colony remains a mystery. Some historians believe the colonists tried to sail back to England and did not make it, while others believe that they perished in escalated conflicts with the local Native Americans. Many historians believe that the colonists may have moved south, to Hatteras Island – a theory that was further bolstered by the recent discovery of a 16th century Signet ring in the town of Buxton.\n\nWhat are the special events in Manteo?\n\nManteo has a myriad of special events throughout the year.

Having the kayaks and paddle boards available, and the campfire with everything you need included (even the s’mores kit!) sold us on the spot. Coffee on the water in the morning with a book was so peaceful. The boathouse had a heated blanket which we didn’t need but was nice to know it was there. Washrooms are clean and nice, and the kitchen area was better than I thought - with the propane cooktop and all your pots and pans, you could definitely cook up a nice meal in there. The hosts we spoke to were very kind, and you can tell how much effort and care has been put into the property.",

    "summary": "Houseboat at The Silverlaken Estate rests on the shore of Silver Lake.  It features a queen bed and is a few steps from the restrooms and shower facilities.  This unique accommodation provides breathtaking views of Silver Lake, minutes from Letchworth State Park and the village of Perry.  We provide bedding, bath towels, and toiletries for our guests.\n\nGuests have access to the docks, shared kitchen, BBQ grills, campfire, kayaks, etc. as part of the Silverlaken Estate.",
    "space": "Things to know about the Houseboat before you book:\n \nDoes it float? \nThe “Houseboat” is a cabin built on a floating platform that is raised up in a hoist. It does not have an engine and only floats when we take it off the hoist and tow it to the local marina for Winter storage.\n \nDue to wave action, it is not comfortable or safe to float the cabin in the water. However, the boat is lifted just a few inches off the water by the hoist, so the guests will enjoy the feel of living “on the water” without the headaches of getting seasick or being knocked over by waves! It is normal for the boat to sway back and forth a few inches in the hoist.\n \nOccupancy/Bedding/Temperature Control\nü  Limited to 2 guests as the unit has 1 queen bed.\nü  The houseboat enjoys the cool breeze off the lake. There is also a ceiling fan above the bed and all the windows have screens. \nü  In the cooler months, an electric blanket and electric radiator is provided.\n\nShared Infrastructure\nü  In the Sauna Cabin (about 50 ft from houseboat) you will find the Sauna room, the indoor shower & bathrooms as well as outdoor tent showers. \nü  Feel free to use the gas grill and any of the picnic tables in the common area.  The kitchen is on the porch of the Sauna Cabin.\nü Kayaks and Standup paddle boards are available at the common area.",
    "access": "The Silverlaken Estate provides a number of amenities including:\n\n✓ Lake Access (Lakeside seating and docks)\n✓ Free Parking on Premises\n✓ Wifi (but very slow and unreliable. Designed to get you offline and enjoying outdoors)\n✓ Heat & Fan \n✓ Bedding and Linens\n✓ Shower amenities\n✓ Free Smore's & Coffee welcome kits\n✓ Common area kitchen: Stove, Refrigerator, Microwave, Coffee Maker, Toaster, Dishes & Silverware\n✓ Camp Fire Pit\n✓ BBQ Grill (propane provided)\n✓ Kayaks & Paddleboards (life vests and paddles included)\n✓ Sauna\n✓ Picnic table\n\n ",
    "notes": "For detailed information on the estate- how to access WIFI, where to find firewood, kayaks, etc. visit\nhttps://silverlaken.com/housemanual/\n\nQuiet Hours/ No Parties\nFor the comfort of our guest, we are serious about tranquility. Quiet hours are in effect from 9 P.M. to 9 A.M. No parties, loud music, raised voices or screaming kids at any hour.   \n\nSelf Check In\nInstructions with details for accessing the rental unit, directions, where to park, Wi-Fi password and such are found in the Airbnb app after the booking has been made.\n\nDirections\nThe Silverlaken Estate is on a rural road.  Please be respectful of neighbors by driving slow on the dirt road to keep down dust.\n\nPlease make sure you are clear about the directions and know the location of your rental unit before you start your drive to Silverlaken.  \n\nDo not drive around the neighborhood looking for the estate and never knock on a neighbor’s door to ask where is Silverlaken.  The map and directions are very clear, but if you have any problems, please contact your host.\n\nHousekeeping \nLinens are professionally dry cleaned and a starter kit of towels, toilet paper, soaps & shampoo is included in each rental unit.  As we do not have full time staff, long-stay guests should know that on-going housekeeping, top up of starter kit items and replacement of linens is not provided, unless additional fees are agreed in advance, before booking is made.\n\nBefore check out, guests are expected to do their own dishes, remove trash (refuse bins are centrally located onsite) and place used linens in a pile.   \n\nGreen Energy\nThe Silverlaken estate is powered by solar panels.  Consider an environmentally friendly approach and use the fans rather than AC when possible and turn off lights/electronics when not in use.\n\nDark Sky Commitment\nBring a flashlight as we intentionally limit lighting between the buildings to reduce light pollution and enjoy the night sky. The advantages include an increased number of stars visible at night, reducing the effects of electric lighting on the environment, improving the well-being, health and safety of both people and wildlife, and cutting down on energy usage. \n\nThings To Do At Silverlaken\nRegistered guests are warmly welcome to use the following infrastructure (free of charge) found in the common area:\n• Kayaks.  In the common area you will find a rack with 10 red kayaks and a bunch of universal fit lifejackets.

Very nice waterfront, quiet location, good internal layout, and few wooden buildings created a perfect weekend getaway vibe. \n We were a little surprised by the fact that a few days before we had to sign an additional agreement  directly with the real Sandra required us to provide the names and ages of all guests including small children and infants.  Reviewing , filling and signing  of that Agreement took us some extra time which is a bit unusual for AirBnB experience.Also, a few days before our arrival date we requested to add two more people to our guest list which did not look like a problem as the Agreement we signed earlier indicated that the property may accept up to 20 people. But that request was strongly declined by the agent. (Our group had only 16 persons including one infant).That was quite frustrating. \n  ",

There is fabulous shopping, food, and entertainment all within walking distance and we could even hear the concert from down the street sitting on our deck! The host, Marcia was wonderful and helpful, attentive to every detail.  We were even lucky enough to meet her in person! We will absolutely be staying at The Cove again in the near future.

    "summary": "Welcome to The Cove, Wilmington's most unique vacation rental community. \n\nFloating atop the Cape Fear River, our houseboats offer an experience unlike any you've had before. \n\nFrom the gentle rocking of the river, to the peaceful view of the sunset, your stay at The Cove is sure to leave you feeling refreshed, restored, and wanting to return again soon.",
    "space": "After parking in our free lot and making the 4 minute stroll down onto the docks of the Port City Marina, you’ll arrive at The Cove, Riverwalk Villas. Secured with dock ties and connected to electricity and water, you'll quickly realize that a stay at our houseboat community offers the perfect mix of adventure, luxury and relaxation.\n\nUpon entering your houseboat, you’ll notice the spacious open concept kitchen/dining/living area and think to yourself, \"I should have brought more friends!\" (Don't worry, there's always next time.) \n\nCooking & Eating:\nWith a dining table that seats four, three benches along the island, and a kitchen stocked with everything you need to make a great meal, you could actually host your next Thanksgiving here. Complementary coffee, creamer and sugar are provided, alongside a drip coffee maker.\n\nLiving Room 1:\nIf cooking isn't your idea of fun, you may be more drawn to the beautifully decorated downstairs living space, where you can relax on the cozy couch surrounded by tall windows that overlook the Marina. \n\nBathroom 1:\nJust past the common area is the first floor bathroom, which features a walk-in shower and full size washer and dryer. Complementary shampoo, conditioner and body wash are provided in each of the bathrooms, as well as laundry pods, dryer sheets, hair dryer and a steamer. \n\nBedroom 1 (Queen):\nConnected by a pocket door is the downstairs bedroom with a Queen bed, large closet, ceiling fan, 40\" Smart TV, and access door to the quaint back patio; a great spot for some quiet reading or alone time.\n\nLiving Room 2:\nAs you make your way upstairs, you'll discover another large living space with comfortable furniture, a 60\" Smart TV, desk & chair, and a beautiful view of the Cape Fear River through the sliding glass doors. \n\nUpstairs Patio:\nJust outside those doors, you'll find yourself on a large patio featuring an outdoor bar (sink & mini fridge), and a variety of comfortable furniture options. This patio is a fan favorite for everything from morning coffee, afternoon reading, evening spirits, or enjoying a meal. In the Summer months, you'll often hear live music coming from Marina Grill, our delicious on-site restaurant, or Live Oak Bank Pavilion Amphitheater, which is only a block away.\n\nBedroom 2 (King):\nBack inside and beyond the living room is the second floor bedroom, featuring a King bed, dresser, large closet, ceiling fan & 55\" Smart TV. \n\nBathroom 2:\nThe pocket door connects you from the bedroom to the second floor full bath, featuring another walk-in shower. \n\nLocation:\n\nThe Cove is located in Port City Marina, which sits on the North end of the Riverwalk in Downtown Wilmington. Just a few steps from the Wilmington Convention Center and one block from both The Wilson Center, and Live Nation's Live Oak Bank Pavilion Amphitheater, a stay at The Cove offers the perfect solution for those wanting to avoid the chaos of parking, event traffic, and needing a DD.\n\nLess than a mile away you'll find the heart of Historic Downtown Wilmington. Whether you choose to stroll along the Riverwalk, take the free trolley, or drive a few blocks down Water Street, getting there is easy. With many local shops, restaurants, breweries, live music, and events, Downtown offers something for everyone to enjoy. Check out our Guidebook or \"Wilmington and Beaches\" online for recommendations and events.\n\nBeyond the borders of Downtown, a quick 8 minute drive or Uber ride will get you to the Wilmington International Airport (ILM), and within a 10 mile radius you'll find Wrightsville Beach, Jungle Rapids amusement/water park, UNCW (Go Seahawks!) and much more.\n\nIf you're interested in bringing your boat, our friends at Port City Marina would love to rent you a slip! Please reach out to them directly to coordinate that for the dates of your stay.\n\nIf this houseboat is not available during your preferred time frame, please check out the listings for our other houseboats at The Cove, and don't hesitate to reach out for assistance. We would love to have you Stay Afloat!",
    "access": "Guests will have access to the entire houseboat for the duration of their stay.",
    "neighborhood": "Port City Marina (PCM) is a gated, full-service, deep water marina featuring over 200 state-of-the-art floating concrete wet slips. Uniquely located on the Cape Fear River, PCM hosts everything from transient boaters to our permanent houseboat community. \n\nThough currently scattered among the docks, we are watching with excitement as our custom built permanent dock is being constructed. This dock will host all 40 houseboats and will feature angled slips, beautiful landscaping, and a community space at the end of the dock.",
    "transit": "Free parking is provided for one vehicle per houseboat. Our parking lot is located about 1,000 feet (4 min walk) from the Marina, so we recommend packing in suitcases with wheels if you have them, and bringing an umbrella or rain jacket. \n\nIf you will have more than one car, please ask us about getting another parking pass or plan to park in one of the two paid parking garages located diagonally from our parking lot. (Pier 33 apartments or Wilmington Convention Center)",

Modern amenities include:  a compost toilet and hot shower (available during the non-freezing seasons) with towels and soap nearby.

Rest assured that our compost toilets are designed with usability in mind. They smell great!  \n\nWe have all been to rural outhouses where this is not the case.  It's the number 1 complaint (or is that #2?). Which is why, when we built each of our toilets facilities, we did something different.  Through management of airflow, separation of liquids from solids, application of saw dust, and optimizing the force of gravity, we have a composting toilet system that has been in place for years with very little odor and maximum sanitation.  So rest easy:  if a member of your party is an \"outhousaphobe\", know that so are we!\n\nCAN'T FIND THE DATES YOU'RE LOOKING FOR?\nCheck out all our Maine Island eco-retreat listings at 1 Big Sustainable Island.\n\nLOOKING FOR A SHORT STAY?  \nSo that guests looking for longer stays have options, our minimum night stay (MNS) requirements tend to start high and then fade away.

Vincent offered free kayak rentals with the stay which I wish we took advantage of, and I also wish we took advantage of their free ride to Boldt Castle which would have saved us $100 (for two people). The house boat is cozy and a unique experience which was well worth the price. The bathroom wasn't the greatest but I wouldn't take marks off for that since the stay wasn't all that expensive. Vincent was a very, friendly and responsive host and it's clear he goes above and beyond for his guests. Would recommend to anyone that's looking to stay here!",

Two of us stayed very comfortably (we each brought a backpack and a suitcase) and used one bed to put our stuff on so we could have a clear path to walk from the front of the boat to the back. Tip: if you have a lot of stuff, there is not a lot of space to store things, so pack light! The deck is cute and gives a great view. Erin was super quick to respond to all of my questions! \n\nThings out of Erin’s control: You can expect some noise from nearby Hot Club on the weekend nights but it’s not bad from the Houseboat. The neighbor boat right next to us was playing music late, and loud. They really loved their bass. \n\nOverall great stay! I loved how close it was to coffee shops, restaurants, and downtown. Would definitely stay again!",

With its whitewashed wooden floors and walls, this charming houseboat offers a unique and inviting atmosphere, ensuring an unforgettable stay.\n\nPerfect for singles, couples, or friends seeking a distinctive getaway, REI DA GAMBIARRA comfortably accommodates up to 3 guests.",
    "space": "REI DE GAMBIARRA: The name of the boat comes from a nickname that the previous owner was called in Brazil which means “the king of invention”  – he was always coming up with ways to fix things on his sailboat without actually having the original parts.  This boat has gone through an extensive remodeling. It has been gutted on the interior and creatively redone. The style of the boat is similar to a Nantucket cottage – it is rustic and basic in its aesthetic.  The walls and floor are done and white similar to a beach cottage in Nantucket and colors to accent the interior are modest with solid blues and linen hues.  \n\nThis boat is recommended for up to 3 people. For four people, it is recommended that two people sleep on one which is very possible. This booking is truly ideal for three people each of whom would have their own bed. \n\nFor amenities, there is a separate bathroom that has a raised shower, a gravity-fed toilet and a sink. There’s plenty of hot water. For warmer days, we have an air conditioning unit. And also for cooler evenings, we offer a space heater which heats everything up nicely on cool evenings.  There’s also a wonderful upper deck that allows panoramic views of the city.   The kitchenette includes a sink, a mini fridge, plates silverware and glasses. \n\nFor modern entertainment there is a flatscreen TV with a Roku and free wifi. A Nintendo Switch can be arranged upon request. \n\nThis is a truly unique opportunity to spend some time aboard a very unique Houseboat - REI DE GAMBIARRA, tremendous care and thought have been taken to provide a unique experience aboard this rare Houseboat.\n\nWe offer parking for multiple cars in a 24/7 offsite lot for free. The lot is a walking distance away so if you are not prepared to walk to the marina this may not be the booking for you.  We are located in the east side of Providence within the hurricane barrier. We are in a very protected marina which offers a safe and very convenient location. We are close to Many Providence attractions including Brown University, Rhode Island School of Design and Federal Hill.",
    "access": "The entire boat will be yours for the duration of your stay.",
    "notes": "Occupancy of 3-4 people is STRICTLY enforced given the close-quarter nature of the marina;  failure to abide by the stated occupancy will result in forfeiture of the guest's security deposit and possible expulsion from the marina.\n\nPlease note that guests should bring their own Bluetooth Sound system if they wish to have music on board.",
    "transit": "The marina is walking distance to the Newport Ferry. Uber is recommended for going into downtown Providence for restaurants or nightlife as parking in Providence can be costly and stressful. For those who love a stroll, Downtown is a pleasant 20 minute walk.  Wickenden Street and the Pedestrian Bridge Restaurants and food Trucks are a 5 minute walk.  Bikes and Scooter rentals are available throughout the neighborhood via Apps.",

    "summary": "Welcome to The Cove, Wilmington's most unique vacation rental community. \n\nFloating atop the Cape Fear River, our dockside villas offer an experience unlike any you've had before. \n\nFrom the gentle rocking of the river, to the peaceful view of the sunset, your stay at The Cove is sure to leave you feeling refreshed, restored, and wanting to return again soon.",
    "space": "After parking (one parking pass per villa) in our free lot and making the 4 minute stroll down onto the docks of the Port City Marina, you’ll arrive at The Cove, Riverwalk Villas. Secured with dock ties and connected to electricity and water, you'll quickly realize that a stay at our dockside community offers the perfect mix of adventure, luxury and relaxation.\n\nUpon entering your villa, you’ll notice the spacious open concept kitchen/dining/living area and think to yourself, \"I should have brought more friends!\" (Don't worry, there's always next time.) \n\nCooking & Eating:\nWith a dining table that seats four, three stools along the island, and a kitchen stocked with everything you need to make a great meal, you could actually host your next Thanksgiving here. Complementary coffee, creamer and sugar are provided, alongside a drip coffee maker.\n\nLiving Room 1:\nIf cooking isn't your idea of fun, you may be more drawn to the beautifully decorated downstairs living space, where you can relax on the cozy couch surrounded by tall windows that overlook the Marina. \n\nBathroom 1:\nJust past the common area is the first floor bathroom, which features a walk-in shower and full size washer and dryer. Complementary shampoo, conditioner and body wash are provided in each of the bathrooms, as well as towels, laundry pods, dryer sheets, hair dryer and a steamer. \n\nBedroom 1 (Queen):\nConnected by a pocket door is the downstairs bedroom with a Queen bed (linens provided), large closet, ceiling fan, Smart TV, and access door to the quaint back patio; a great spot for some quiet reading or alone time.\n\nLiving Room 2 (Sofa bed):\nAs you make your way upstairs, you'll discover another large living space with a sectional couch (with pull out sleeper), 55\" Smart TV, desk and chair, and a beautiful view of the Cape Fear River through the sliding glass doors. \n\nUpstairs Patio:\nJust outside those doors, you'll find yourself on a large patio featuring an outdoor bar (sink & mini fridge), and a variety of comfortable furniture options. This patio is a fan favorite for everything from morning coffee, afternoon reading, evening spirits, or enjoying a meal. In the Summer months, you'll often hear live music coming from Marina Grill, our delicious on-site restaurant, or Live Oak Bank Pavilion Amphitheater, which is only a block away.\n\nBedroom 2 (King):\nBack inside and beyond the living room is the second floor bedroom, featuring a King bed (linens provided), dresser, large closet, ceiling fan & 50\" Smart TV. \n\nBathroom 2:\nThe pocket door connects you from the bedroom to the second floor full bathroom with shower, and towels provided\n\nLocation:\n\nThe Cove is located in Port City Marina, which sits on the North end of the Riverwalk in Downtown Wilmington. Just a few steps from the Wilmington Convention Center and one block from both The Wilson Center, and Live Nation's Live Oak Bank Pavilion Amphitheater, a stay at The Cove offers the perfect solution for those wanting to avoid the chaos of parking, event traffic, and needing a DD.\n\nLess than a mile away you'll find the heart of Historic Downtown Wilmington. Whether you choose to stroll along the Riverwalk, take the free trolley, or drive a few blocks down Water Street, getting there is easy. With many local shops, restaurants, breweries, live music, and events, Downtown offers something for everyone to enjoy. Check out our Guidebook or \"Wilmington and Beaches\" online for recommendations and events.\n\nBeyond the borders of Downtown, a quick 8 minute drive or Uber ride will get you to the Wilmington International Airport (ILM), and within a 10 mile radius you'll find Wrightsville Beach, Jungle Rapids amusement/water park, UNCW (Go Seahawks!) and much more.\n\nIf you're interested in bringing your boat, our friends at Port City Marina would love to rent you a slip. Please reach out to them directly to coordinate that for the dates of your stay.\n\nIf this Villa is not available during your preferred time frame, please check out the listings for our other Riverwalk Villas at The Cove, and don't hesitate to reach out for assistance. We would love to have you Stay Afloat!",
    "access": "Guests have full access to the entire villa during their stay",
    "neighborhood": "Port City Marina (PCM) is a gated, full-service, deep water marina featuring over 200 state-of-the-art floating concrete wet slips. Uniquely located on the Cape Fear River, PCM hosts everything from transient boaters to our permanent floating villas. \n\nThough currently scattered among the docks, we are watching with excitement as our custom built permanent dock is being constructed. This dock will host all 40 villas and will feature angled slips, beautiful landscaping, and a community space at the end of the dock.",
    "transit": "Free parking is provided for one vehicle per villa. Our parking lot is located about 1,000 feet (4 min walk) from the Marina, so we recommend packing in suitcases with wheels if you have them, and bringing an umbrella or rain jacket. \n\nIf you will have more than one car, you can park in one of the two paid parking garages located diagonally from our parking lot. (Pier 33 apartments or Wilmington Convention Center)",

There is a quite time from 10:00pm and 7:00am. Please no\nload music or load voices during this period. \nYou can spend your time on one of 3 decks . Rear deck has gas grill and is in the sun. The forward deck has built in bench and a table and chairs , it is in the shade. The upper deck will provide best views, it has table and chairs . It is also in the sun during the windy months of April and May while I have  canvas top off.\nThe galley has nice dinette that 4 people can sit to eat or play some card or board game.\nBut the best part is the river . You can just sit there and be amazed of the beautiful sunsets or just watch all the wildlife. \nYou can fish right off the boat and might pull in one, of a dozen species.  \nOr you could just jump in the kayaks , go up river and take a calm ride down pennyroyal creek.     \nMake a week of it and you could spend a day or 2 on the river. A day in Downtown Georgetown, maybe you will take the fox rabbit tours where they ride you around downtown and the neighborhood . Giving the history of all the churches and homes and who lived in them. Or you might take one of the tour boat out into winyah bay to see the light house  or ride the rivers. \n Head out to the beach for a day . Pawleys island beach 12 miles away . Huntington Beach State Park 15 miles away. Don’t forget Myrtle beach just 25 miles away .\nWe are also a 1hr country drive to downtown Charleston .

There was a dock in walking distance we took our paddle boards off of. Also, the marina had live music Saturday evening which was an added bonus. There was a little boat cafe at the marina that was open on the weekend and had amazing breakfast and lunch options! We will definitely be back here!",

I think the guidebook could have been improved with more recommendations and specific instructions, and I was a little disappointed by the futon as it was somewhat unclear how to set it up and was not very comfortable to sleep on. Even a mattress pad to add on top would have gone a long way. Those things are a little nit-picky, but for the price I would’ve appreciated a better night’s sleep and clearer instructions/recommendations. Overall a great spot and would recommend staying here for the unique experience and the proximity to Ithaca and the finger lakes area as a whole!",

The houseboat is lovely and adorable. it was great to be able to walk to restaurants that were right on the beach and bars too. we enjoyed walking downtown and listening to live music at two different places. you can't beat how close the houseboat is to the ferry to get to Put-in-Bay.  Drinking coffee on the deck was a great way to start the mornings.",

It is absolutely beautiful！The only thing that would have been helpful for us to know when we were trying to find the floating home is the physical address that is listed is not correct so don't go by that if you're using GPS. Carefully read the message you receive from the host just before check in. The physical address and the Marine, where the house is located, are two different things. We came in really late at night so it was dark which was a disadvantage. We finally stopped at a bar and the manager was able to help us out. This is just a tidbit for the next guest trying to find it in the dark.",

The group I stayed with wanted to have the space to lounge and gather in while still having access to nightlife and other activities. Located on the bay with private access to the waters and just a few blocks from the beach and boardwalk, we had SO much fun and it was all very accessible. We loved that the house felt like hone - it had all the necessities to be able to fully enjoy the property and it’s amenities. We loved utilizing the fishing gear and made ourselves comfortable on the Adirondack chairs out back to watch the sunrise and sunsets on the water. Our host was also very responsive, which we appreciated. Would definitely stay here again with another big group!!",

    "summary": "Quite possibly the coolest home in Ocean City. You are in the heart of Ocean City without all the noise.  Four blocks from the ocean and boardwalk.  Lots of fun boat watching and fishing off the back pier.  This home is over 50 years old and takes a beating from the water so if you want a modern perfect rental this is not the home for you. If your group wants a unique experience that they will talk about the rest of their lives then you should definitely book this home.",
    "space": "I do not live in this home. It is a vacation rental home so you will not feel like you are invading our space.  You have use of the entire home. This home fits 3-4 families or 7 couples. The home has 11 beds plus 3 twin pull out couch/chairs.  Two of the beds are queen-size and three are full-size, so if you plan it perfectly and share beds you can sleep 20 but it may be tight. \nThe house used to be two separate condos but now interior stairs combining the two. There is a door that can closed to separate the two units. Staying in this home is a unique one-of-a-kind experience. Kind of like staying in a houseboat. There are many homes to rent in Ocean City but none like this.  This is the only single-family home in Ocean City built on pilings entirely in the water.  Every week we have large groups renting the home so minor things will break before we can fix them at times. We do our best and take pride in keeping this home as nice as possible while still allowing large groups to rent.",
    "access": "Check-in is at 4:00 but 75% of the time it is cleaned and ready by 2:00.   You can message me the day before and I will let you know if it is rented the night before. If not, you should be able to have earlier access. \nYou have access to the entire home and all the decks around the property.\nDo to the large groups staying at the house you need to bring paper towels, dish towels, toilet paper…. Both kitchens are fully stocked with pots, pans, cooking utensils, plate, bowls, silverware, glasses, mugs. The home has pillows and lots of blankets.",
    "notes": "Be careful with little children on the outside pier.  It is not a deck. The railings are not safe like a deck. Piers do not require guard rails but I added cables for extra safety instead of having nothing.  \nThere are six TVs. The downstairs living room has basic cable. The other five TVs have Amazon fire stick, Prime, Disney Plus. High speed Wi-Fi. \nThere should be fishing poles and beach stuff available as long as other guests do not take them. I stock the house every May and when I periodically come down. There is a Propane bbq grill and normally propane. In rare occasions a guest will forget to turn it off and you may have to exchange it for more propane. There is a baby pack and play, iron, and two hair dryers. \n\nBe respectful to the year-round neighbors and do not play loud music or be excessively loud outside after 8 PM. Do not throw any parties with guests that are not staying at the home. The neighbors will call the cops and you will be evicted. \n\nGuest agrees to pay an excessive housekeeping or maintenance fee if Property is not left in the following condition: \n1) Remove all food from refrigerator and all trash from Property. 2) Clean dishes and cooking utensils and properly store them. 3) Put fishing poles back on rack 4) Leave furniture arranged as it was found. 5) Check all drawers and closets for items left behind. 6) Close all windows and lock the doors when leaving;  check out is 11:00 am. \nc. Toilets shall not be used for any purpose other than that for which they were constructed and no soap, sweepings, sanitary products, diapers, rubbish, rags or garbage shall be placed therein.\nd. Guest is responsible for any additional costs associated with cleaning, repairs or loss of rental income to Owner, including but not limited to the following: 1) smoking in property; 2) bringing unauthorized pets into the property; and 3) excessive uncleanliness or damage caused as a result of Guests occupancy.",
    "neighborhood": "You are in the heart of Ocean City without all the noise. Two blocks off the main strip. Four blocks from the ocean and boardwalk, two blocks from restaurants and shopping.  Lots of fun watching and fishing off the back pier.\n2 blocks from Pickles pub, 7 blocks from the Da lazy lizard. 8 blocks from the Taphouse on the boardwalk and 7 blocks from Shananigans on the boardwalk. Private surfing lessons Malibu Surf shop only 4 blocks away. Playground and skate park 4 blocks way.",
    "transit": "Park you car and leave it there. Plenty of stuff to do within a mile walk.  If there is an open spot across the street grab it right away and keep your car there for the stay. Use the 2-3 cars that you park on the property if you need to drive. This way you are guaranteed a spot when you get back.",
    "interaction": "I do not live in Ocean City. I live in Annapolis. You are free to text or to email. You can call if it’s real important.",
    "house_rules": "Suitable for children under two but you must realize that the exterior of the home is built in the water. It is like being on a fishing pier. We did install wire guard rails but it is not as safe as being on a deck. Little children must be watched closely outside. \nMust do dishes. No blasting music outside. No jumping off of 2nd story deck.",

It was a quick drive into downtown Portsmouth, which made going to dinner so convenient.  It was about 30 minutes to long sands beach in York, which was great for a beach day or two!  I even enjoyed a few paddles on the Piscataqua river with my kayak, but be warned that the tide is no joke and can pull you out to the ocean if you get too close to the bridge when the tide is going out.  Thank you Tom and Carol for a wonderful trip!  We would love to come back some day!",

    "summary": "This quaint houseboat is located at a small privately owned Marina on Sagamore Creek just 2 miles from downtown Portsmouth. From the Marina you can rent kayaks and paddleboards or bring a small skiff that you can tie up next to the houseboat. Explore the creek and back channels of the seacoast area where you'll find bald eagles, hawks and other wildlife. Great bird watching right from the back deck.",
    "space": "This unique accommodation has all the features of a small apartment. 12'x40' space, separate bedroom with a queen size bed and closet for storage. Two single beds in a loft that overlook the open concept living area. The kitchen has 2 burners and a counter top oven (InstaPot), apartment size fridge and microwave. You will occasionally feel movement as it is a boat. And it does not leave the dock.",
    "notes": "Enjoy the outside deck/patio with your morning coffee or an evening cocktail. \nNext door to the Marina is a restaurant and bar featuring your favorite seafood. Within walking or biking distance is another restaurant featuring homemade ice cream. Keep going and you'll get to the beautiful Wentworth by Sea Hotel just a mile from the Marina. There you'll find various dining choices, or spoil yourself with a spa treatment. \nA quick 2 mile drive (or bike ride) will take you into historic downtown Portsmouth where you'll find shops, restaurants, music and theater.",

I had my dog for the first night, arriving late (after midnight). The houseboats are very well insulated and I never heard a thing. Also Greg accommodated our late arrival making it easy!  The arrangement of the houseboats was excellent. They were in a quiet and beautiful environment. The boat was very comfortable, clean and well set up.  I LOVED the rooftop deck -having my morning coffee there with beautiful views. I would rent it again in a minute!  I also loved the outdoor shower! Fabulous!",

What a surprise that a houseboat was one of the best Airbnbs we have stayed at (even for my mom who is very sensitive to motion sickness—wasn’t phased). We were allowed early checkin which saved our trip, since my son was desperately needing a nap. Bedding and linens were so well appointed. Thoughtful details like varying firmness pillows and white cotton linens and I w cold air conditioning were obvious. Walking to Marina Grill for live music rounded out a super easy night and saved us from dragging 3 small children downtown for dinner. Absolutely great! Thank you!!!",

The marina was helpful and it was so close to our place. The host was fabulous, the location was perfect and had great views! We had two house boats and asked if we could be close, the host and her team accomplished that accommodation and it was perfect for our group! The kitchen was so big and nice, the outside porches were the most wonderful place for a night cap or morning coffee. I seriously already have another trip in my wishlist and I can’t wait to go back! I’ve told all my friends to pick a date and let’s do it! These places were so swanky but also simple living. Best of both worlds!!!!",

    "summary": "Welcome to The Cove, Wilmington's most unique vacation rental community. \n\nFloating atop the Cape Fear River, our houseboats offer an experience unlike any you've had before. \n\nFrom the gentle rocking of the river, to the peaceful view of the sunset, your stay at The Cove is sure to leave you feeling refreshed, restored, and wanting to return again soon.",
    "space": "After parking in our free lot and making the 4 minute stroll down onto the docks of the Port City Marina, you’ll arrive at The Cove, Riverwalk Villas. Secured with dock ties and connected to electricity and water, you'll quickly realize that a stay at our dockside community offers the perfect mix of adventure, luxury and relaxation.\n\nUpon entering your villa, you’ll notice the spacious open concept kitchen/dining/living area and think to yourself, \"I should have brought more friends!\" (Don't worry, there's always next time.) \n\nCooking & Eating:\nWith a dining table that seats four, three benches along the island, and a kitchen stocked with everything you need to make a great meal, you could actually host your next Thanksgiving here. Complementary coffee, creamer and sugar are provided, alongside a drip coffee maker.\n\nLiving Room 1:\nIf cooking isn't your idea of fun, you may be more drawn to the beautifully decorated downstairs living space, where you can relax on the cozy couch surrounded by tall windows that overlook the Marina. \n\nBathroom 1:\nJust past the common area is the first floor bathroom, which features a walk-in shower and full size washer and dryer. Complementary shampoo, conditioner and body wash are provided in each of the bathrooms, as well as laundry pods, dryer sheets, hair dryer and a steamer. \n\nBedroom 1 (Queen):\nConnected by a pocket door is the downstairs bedroom with a Queen bed, large closet, ceiling fan, 40\" Smart TV, and access door to the quaint back patio; a great spot for some quiet reading or alone time.\n\nLiving Room 2 (Sofa bed):\nAs you make your way upstairs, you'll discover another large living space with a sectional couch (with pull out sleeper), 55\" Smart TV, desk and chair, and a beautiful view of the Cape Fear River through the sliding glass doors. \n\nUpstairs Patio:\nJust outside those doors, you'll find yourself on a large patio featuring an outdoor bar (sink & mini fridge), and a variety of comfortable furniture options. This patio is a fan favorite for everything from morning coffee, afternoon reading, evening spirits, or enjoying a meal. In the Summer months, you'll often hear live music coming from Marina Grill, our delicious on-site restaurant, or Live Oak Bank Pavilion Amphitheater, which is only a block away.\n\nBedroom 2 (King):\nBack inside and beyond the living room is the second floor bedroom, featuring a King bed, dresser, large closet, ceiling fan & 55\" Smart TV. \n\nBathroom 2:\nThe pocket door connects you from the bedroom to the second floor full bath.\n\nLocation:\n\nThe Cove is located in Port City Marina, which sits on the North end of the Riverwalk in Downtown Wilmington. Just a few steps from the Wilmington Convention Center and one block from both The Wilson Center, and Live Nation's Live Oak Bank Pavilion Amphitheater, a stay at The Cove offers the perfect solution for those wanting to avoid the chaos of parking, event traffic, and needing a DD.\n\nLess than a mile away you'll find the heart of Historic Downtown Wilmington. Whether you choose to stroll along the Riverwalk, take the free trolley, or drive a few blocks down Water Street, getting there is easy. With many local shops, restaurants, breweries, live music, and events, Downtown offers something for everyone to enjoy. Check out our Guidebook or \"Wilmington and Beaches\" online for recommendations and events.\n\nBeyond the borders of Downtown, a quick 8 minute drive or Uber ride will get you to the Wilmington International Airport (ILM), and within a 10 mile radius you'll find Wrightsville Beach, Jungle Rapids amusement/water park, UNCW (Go Seahawks!) and much more.\n\nIf you're interested in bringing your boat, our friends at Port City Marina would love to rent you a slip! Please reach out to them directly to coordinate that for the dates of your stay.\n\nIf this Villa is not available during your preferred time frame, please check out the listings for our other Riverwalk Villas at The Cove, and don't hesitate to reach out for assistance. We would love to have you Stay Afloat!",
    "access": "Guests will have full access to the entire villa for the duration of their stay.",
    "neighborhood": "Port City Marina (PCM) is a gated, full-service, deep water marina featuring over 200 state-of-the-art floating concrete wet slips. Uniquely located on the Cape Fear River, PCM hosts everything from transient boaters to our permanent floating villas. \n\nThough currently scattered among the docks, we are watching with excitement as our custom built permanent dock is being constructed. This dock will host all 40 villas and will feature angled slips, beautiful landscaping, and a community space at the end of the dock.",
    "transit": "Free parking is provided for one vehicle per villa. Our parking lot is located about 1,000 feet (4 min walk) from the Marina, so we recommend packing in suitcases with wheels if you have them, and bringing an umbrella or rain jacket. \n\nIf you will have more than one car, you can park in one of the two paid parking garages located diagonally from our parking lot. (Pier 33 apartments or Wilmington Convention Center)",
    "house_rules": "-No flushing of anything other than natural waste and septic safe toilet paper\n-Children under the age of 12 must be supervised at all times while in the marina\n-Absolutely no swimming allowed - the current in the Cape Fear River is strong and dangerous\n-No smoking or illicit drugs\n-Failure to return the parking pass upon check-out will result in a $50.00 fee\n-Failure to return the front door key upon check-out will result in a $300.00 fee",

The full kitchen, the walkable restaurant, the private beach, the ability to leave our trailered boat right outside our front door at the marina.  And access to a world class fishery outside our front door.\n\nIt was everything I saw in the images and more. We will definitely look to come back and bring our family with us.",

(Less than 5 mins. walking to the edge of downtown.) This tiny home was modern and has all the amenities you need, and then some! Everything was very clean and communication with the hosts was superb. Our favorite part of the stay was relaxing on the downstairs deck for coffee/sunrise and then relaxing on the upstairs deck for sunset. The house was positioned with a great view of downtown, which lights up nicely at night. We loved watching the wildlife from the deck and even saw a gator! While the marina was active, we never once were disturbed by any neighbors. Being right next to the riverboat was also very cool. Plus, there were a couple restaurants right there in the marina as well.  This place is highly recommended and I can't wait to come back!",

Thank you so much, 10/10 would recommend.",

We were able to just relax and enjoy. Location was awesome, having the riverwalk and historic downtown Sanford within a few minutes walk. Jay and Teresa were quick to respond to any inquiries, their communication was impeccable. We would highly recommend staying here, and would do so again. Thank you both so much!",

    "summary": "You'll love this unique romantic escape located in historic downtown Sanford! \nThis is a nearly new built top of the line Houseboat and you will be amazed at all the amenities fit on this 12x40 floating tiny home. \nNicely suited for one couple. One step to get in and then all on one level other than the upper deck. (Ladder) Max occupancy at any time is 4. \nWalking distance to downtown restaurants, shops and so much more.\nNote that this is a very small space if you are used to a full size home.",
    "space": "Our floating bungalow is like a tiny house or an RV but it's bigger than that at 12' wide x 32' long cabin size. But it is very small compared to a regular house. Space is well utilized. High end appliances are a little smaller than normal but it works great for a couple.",
    "notes": "Maximum occupancy at any time is 4 persons with maximum 2 people staying overnight. It's very nice but small.",
    "neighborhood": "This is a working marina. Some yachts and house boats are live aboard, so you can expect a few neighbors about.",
    "transit": "Free public parking is readily available. Some weekend event crowds take a lot of the spaces but even then, you can typically find spots within a block or so. We typically walk to the downtown area which is just a couple blocks away. There are also a couple good restaurants right on marina island.",
    "house_rules": "Maximum occupancy of 4 persons at any time. Maximum 2 persons overnight.\n\nPlease Read!\nDo not lose gate key!\n$500 lost key fee $300 lock out fee\nThe marina will not help you. If late at night, you will be locked out until the next day!!",

The place was spotless, the AC worked like a champ, the bed was super comfy, there were so many nice finishing touches, all of which let you know that your host is interested in your well being. But the place! Oh my gosh! Your literally and comfortably sleeping on water. You’re on Stagger’s beautiful expansive in-the-country property where you might chance upon a cat (or two), see some chickens, and you can cast a line from the “back porch” of the “Pond Tune.” Sopping here really gives you a sense of the beauty of South Georgia. While there, there’s not a moment when you’re staying there that you don’t say: “Wow … this is very special!” I can’t wait to return to this treasure of a place. Highly recommended! Thank you, Stagger!",

The hosts were very welcoming and accommodating and the boat house named \"Pond tunes\" was absolutely perfect. Not sure what my favorite part was.... being rocked to sleep on the water, waking up and reading our Bibles and drinking coffee on the water, getting to tap into our adventurous side exploring and fishing the 50 acres with the canoe, kayaks, and boat available, or the enjoyment and relaxation all over my hubby thus weekend. Nah, no contest, it was definitely him. 🥰 We even requested a late checkout because we weren't ready to leave.  Stagger Lee Music/ RV Park we will be back!",

We were able to disconnect from technology and enjoy one another.  It was the perfect place for our middle school kids to explore the great outdoors. We enjoyed fishing from the paddle boat. canoeing, paddle boarding, swiming, and the trampoline. We enjoyed  relaxing evenings grilling and eating on the lake, topping the evening off with a camp fire on the beach. The boat is a 10 min drive from Lake Erie, a short walk to Horse Play stables, and conveniently located to stores and restaurants. It is private and peaceful. Rob and Meg are exceptional hosts. Our kids are begging to return every year. \n\nTo fully relax and unwind, we recommend a longer stay- 1 or 2 nights is not enough. \n\nEnjoy!",

Anytime we needed something; Rob was there right away. He was even thoughtful enough to relocate the inflatable water trampoline closer to the boat so we could watch our kids easier.

It was just what we needed to step away from the fast pace city life and get centered with nature again. I’d like to say that we did a lot while we were there (because there were several spots in the area we wanted to try out) but if I’m honest we mostly laid around on the top deck to get some sun and napped on the couch while watching movies! The natural rock of the boat was like melatonin for me lol Carley was awesome and very quick to respond when we had questions. Overall, we had the best experience and will definitely be booking again in the future!",

    "summary": "Looking for a real lake front getaway? This houseboat is the perfect, unique stay. 25 min from Charlotte! It is equipped with a full kitchen, stocked with everything you’d need. 3 bedrooms with queen size beds & 2 full bathrooms. Spacious living room & plenty of outdoor space for grilling out & hanging out. You won’t find a better view of Lake Wylie’s sunsets than on the roof top bar or front porch of this boat! The boat does NOT leave the dock.",
    "space": "All bedrooms have queen size beds. \n\nThe kitchen and living room are very spacious. The bathrooms are large enough to easily get ready in. The outdoor living space is huge! \n\nDo keep in mind this boat is in the water. It stays at the dock but you will feel and hear waves! Also keep in mind, it will smell like a boat as well. Although it looks like a home and is the size of a home it is still a boat! \n\nThere are some things that come with lake life. Like insects. There are spiders. We knock the spiderwebs down and spray weekly but the water spiders are relentless and come back! The plus side is that they feed on mosquitos and are harmless to humans. We do our best to keep them away but we can only do so much. This is part of living on the water! \n\nYou will park at the marina and walk around the back of the building to the stairs. You’ll walk straight down the first dock all the way to the end where the houseboat is docked. Take a left to get to the front door of the boat. Keep in mind it is somewhat of a long walk to the boat.\n\nFollow us on Insta @thedoghouseonwylie for more pictures and videos!",
    "access": "The whole boat",
    "notes": "Swimming is not allowed at the marina as it is not safe near all of the boats.\n\nThere will be some spiders but we leave out broomsticks and spider spray to knock them down. We spray weekly and clean weekly to get rid of them but they come back. \n\nIf you leave food or trash out on the boat there is a raccoon that will find its way down to munch on it! Please be prepared to clean up after yourself.\n\nThe bathrooms on the houseboat are like an RV. The toilets are identical to RV toilets. The water may have a slight odor due to sitting in the pipes between renters but it disappears as the water gets ran and the pipes/tank get flushed out. We treat our water tanks and the water comes directly from the marina. It is clean water!\n\nWe want people to be aware beforehand of how houseboat living is. This houseboat is a blast to stay on but it may not be for some people. If you are in for an adventure on the water then this is for you!",
    "neighborhood": "The boat is 25 min from downtown Charlotte and the airport! You’ll be close enough to enjoy the city but far enough away to relax! Lake Wylie has plenty to offer as well if you don’t want to head into the city. Papa Doc’s (a restaurant on the lake) is right across the bridge from the houseboat. There are plenty of gas stations, grocery stores and other restaurants right down the road as well. Go for a hike in McDowell park, it is right on Lake Wylie and only a minute drive from the marina. Boat rentals are available on Lake Wylie too - Search Boat Rentals of Lake Wylie. You can also rent kayaks over at the boat landing by Papa Doc's. There's plenty to do here!",
    "transit": "Parking is free at the marina.",
    "interaction": "We live right down the road so we can be right over if there are any issues!",
    "house_rules": "No parties. \nBoat does not move from the dock. \nNo swimming is allowed due to the risk of electrocution and boat traffic. \nIf extra cleaning or laundry is required there will be an added cleaning fee.",

The slips are there, ramps, and gas pumps.  The houseboat is pristine.  Very clean, easy to access and all the amenities needed are included.  I like to go into town at night and ubers found me with no problem.  If you want to remain on site, you have the luxury of either the convience shop, or the Tiki Hut for some good food and drinks.  I rebooked the following weekend.  Highly recommended!",

Looking to restore mind and body the boathouse worked it's magic. It is private, beautiful outside, and inside with everything spotlessly clean. The queen bed (only bed used) was comfortable as were the sofa and chairs which were perfect for lounging and taking in the view. It felt like home where much thought had been given to create its lovely decor with beautiful area rugs, and harmonious colors.\n\nRalph is an outstanding Airbnb host. We instantly felt we had made a friend upon first meeting him as he gave us our ride out to the boathouse. He is the kind of friend who respected our privacy, yet someone who could be counted upon if needed. He was only a text away always with a quick response ready and willing for whatever was necessary. With many thanks to Ralph, our stay was five stars all the way.",

We were very pleased how the docks protected our boats from being rocked by incoming waves and the location was fantastic… deep clear water for swimming, and everything from a water trampoline, to kayak’s and fishing poles to enjoy the river. The beds were super comfortable and the kitchen stocked with everything you could need for meal preparation. The view from the upper deck can’t be beat, making morning coffee, afternoon wine, or evening beer even more enjoyable. We will definitely be booking again.",

Every thing was clean and beautifully decorated. Marcia was very communicative from beginning to end. I felt well prepared before I came and decided to stay an extra night, and Marcia was gracious enough to help me with that process, and it literally took less than 10 minutes. The area was beautiful you can look out onto the marina from the back balcony and even hear the live music from the restaurant across the marina. There was lots of things to do in the area including restaurants, the beach and go karting. The best part was the kids had  their own space upstairs with their own room and living room so gave me and my husband privacy on the 1st level. I’m already planning my return trip!",

    "summary": "Welcome to The Cove, Wilmington's most unique vacation rental community. \n\nFloating atop the Cape Fear River, our houseboats offer an experience unlike any you've had before. \n\nFrom the gentle rocking of the river, to the peaceful view of the sunset, your stay at The Cove is sure to leave you feeling refreshed, restored, and wanting to return again soon.",
    "space": "After parking in our free lot and making the 4 minute stroll down onto the docks of the Port City Marina, you’ll arrive at The Cove, Riverwalk Villas. Secured with dock ties and connected to electricity and water, you'll quickly realize that a stay at our houseboat community offers the perfect mix of adventure, luxury and relaxation.\n\nUpon entering your houseboat, you’ll notice the spacious open concept kitchen/dining/living area and think to yourself, \"I should have brought more friends!\" (Don't worry, there's always next time.) \n\nCooking & Eating:\nWith a dining table that seats four, three benches along the island, and a kitchen stocked with everything you need to make a great meal, you could actually host your next Thanksgiving here. Complementary coffee, creamer and sugar are provided, alongside a drip coffee maker.\n\nLiving Room 1:\nIf cooking isn't your idea of fun, you may be more drawn to the beautifully decorated downstairs living space, where you can relax on the cozy couch surrounded by tall windows that overlook the Marina. \n\nBathroom 1:\nJust past the common area is the first floor bathroom, which features a walk-in shower and full size washer and dryer. Complementary shampoo, conditioner and body wash are provided in each of the bathrooms, as well as laundry pods, dryer sheets, hair dryer and a steamer. \n\nBedroom 1 (Queen):\nConnected by a pocket door is the downstairs bedroom with a Queen bed, large closet, ceiling fan, 40\" Smart TV, and access door to the quaint back patio; a great spot for some quiet reading or alone time.\n\nLiving Room 2 (Sofa bed):\nAs you make your way upstairs, you'll discover another large living space with a sectional couch (with pull out sleeper), 60\" Smart TV, desk and chair, and a beautiful view of the Cape Fear River through the sliding glass doors. \n\nUpstairs Patio:\nJust outside those doors, you'll find yourself on a large patio featuring an outdoor bar (sink & mini fridge), and a variety of comfortable furniture options. This patio is a fan favorite for everything from morning coffee, afternoon reading, evening spirits, or enjoying a meal. In the Summer months, you'll often hear live music coming from Marina Grill, our delicious on-site restaurant, or Live Oak Bank Pavilion Amphitheater, which is only a block away.\n\nBedroom 2 (King):\nBack inside and beyond the living room is the second floor bedroom, featuring a King bed, dresser, large closet, ceiling fan & 55\" Smart TV. \n\nBathroom 2:\nThe pocket door connects you from the bedroom to the second floor full bath, featuring another walk-in shower. \n\nLocation:\n\nThe Cove is located in Port City Marina, which sits on the North end of the Riverwalk in Downtown Wilmington. Just a few steps from the Wilmington Convention Center and one block from both The Wilson Center, and Live Nation's Live Oak Bank Pavilion Amphitheater, a stay at The Cove offers the perfect solution for those wanting to avoid the chaos of parking, event traffic, and needing a DD.\n\nLess than a mile away you'll find the heart of Historic Downtown Wilmington. Whether you choose to stroll along the Riverwalk, take the free trolley, or drive a few blocks down Water Street, getting there is easy. With many local shops, restaurants, breweries, live music, and events, Downtown offers something for everyone to enjoy. Check out our Guidebook or \"Wilmington and Beaches\" online for recommendations and events.\n\nBeyond the borders of Downtown, a quick 8 minute drive or Uber ride will get you to the Wilmington International Airport (ILM), and within a 10 mile radius you'll find Wrightsville Beach, Jungle Rapids amusement/water park, UNCW (Go Seahawks!) and much more.\n\nIf you're interested in bringing your boat, our friends at Port City Marina would love to rent you a slip! Please reach out to them directly to coordinate that for the dates of your stay.\n\nIf this houseboat is not available during your preferred time frame, please check out the listings for our other houseboats at The Cove, and don't hesitate to reach out for assistance. We would love to have you Stay Afloat!",
    "access": "Guests have access to the entire houseboat for the duration of their stay.",
    "neighborhood": "Port City Marina (PCM) is a gated, full-service, deep water marina featuring over 200 state-of-the-art floating concrete wet slips. Uniquely located on the Cape Fear River, PCM hosts everything from transient boaters to our permanent houseboat community. \n\nThough currently scattered among the docks, we are watching with excitement as our custom built permanent dock is being constructed. This dock will host all 40 houseboats and will feature angled slips, beautiful landscaping, and a community space at the end of the dock.",
    "transit": "Free parking is provided for one vehicle per houseboat. Our parking lot is located about 1,000 feet (4 min walk) from the Marina, so we recommend packing in suitcases with wheels if you have them, and bringing an umbrella or rain jacket. \n\nIf you will have more than one car, you can park in one of the two paid parking garages located diagonally from our parking lot. (Pier 33 apartments or Wilmington Convention Center)",

The bed had a nice memory foam topper on it that made it very comfortable. There were a few games on the boat as well. Kitchen was perfect for what we needed - fridge, microwave, coffee maker. The bathroom is just a small set up port-a-jon, but the bathroom is a short walk across the dirt lot along with some outdoor showers. There are also nice showers near the office/checkin area. The “porch” on the boat faces away from the harbor which was fine but he has other rentals that have harbor facing “porches”. There is a nice dock a short distance from the houseboat that leads into the lake that you can jump off of and hang out - perfect little perk to float/launch a paddle board from there! Would love to stay and check out another one of the houseboats sometime!",

WiFi and the park pass was a definite bonus.  Only thing to be aware of is the shower. I’m a big boy. So it was definitely a tight squeeze. But for most it would do fine.  We will definitely be back next summer.",

In order to provide a well-rounded review I do however have to say the screens could do with a clean to remove the bugs, and the interior paneling is looking a bit tired.\nThe town is about a 15 minute walk away (we ate at Joe Simcoe's twice - very good food), and Barney's restaurant is conveniently located 30 seconds from the property.\nOverall we had an enjoyable stay.",

Not easy for elderly parents. \nJeremiah was very easy to communicate with and responded quickly to texts. \nThe Lake was incredible! Perfect weather and water temp for the week of the 4th! 😎🇺🇲",

Plenty of space and you have the ability to either hang together or find your own secret spot for peace and quiet. The best part is you can bring your furbaby! They even have a fenced yard which is so convenient and makes having them outside worry free. While the inside is great, it is the outside which is the draw. Beautiful setting, lots of deer in the yard, and many leveled decks to enjoy the views while having tea or bbq’ing. We thoroughly enjoyed setting up an inflatable movie theater outside on the deck in the evening and eating s’mores. Fair warning, there are lots of stairs headed down to the dock, but by the end of the week you will have buns of steel, and being able to access the great dock below is worth it. Renting a boat was super easy and fishing, kayaking and laying on the giant mat was a treat for all. Something for everyone! Thanks Jeremiah!",

I’ve never stayed in a houseboat until now. We did not, however, you may experience some motion sickness during tidal changes if you’re prone to it. But, Joseph built a sea wall, for lack of a better term, to limit movement, which I thought was brilliant. Overall, we had an amazing time and we really enjoyed Joseph’s home.",

(Condiments, coffee, bags etc.)  Kim was very responsive and very fair in-spite of my puppies chewing up a few things. She even provided cookies for the pups. The kids were fighting for the cookies until I read they were dog cookies! Games for kids, EASY access to TV.    The marina provides wagons for off loading your things from your car to the House Boat but I was glad we had brought our own as we could not locate one upon arrival. The most enjoyable time was just relaxing off the back and watching the grandchildren catch fish and releasing them back into the water all while grilling lunch and dinner on the grill! \n\nEasy boat rentals which enhanced our adventure and brought back wonderful memories of growing up on a lake. Sharing this with family was amazing. \n\nThank you again Kim! \n\nBarb",

    "summary": "Welcome to our floating cottage located at Hickory Star Marina in Maynardville TN.  Our cottage is anchored out in the water so you must have a boat, raft, canoe, or jet ski to get to it.  It’s a perfect place to get away from it all and decompress.  Bed accommodations include two bunk beds and one couch.  Kitchenette is furnished with propane stove and microwave. Propane grill on the floating deck is available.  Running water from the lake used for all sinks and shower. Nice simple clean place",
    "space": "We have a gas can on site which can be filled at the marina to run the portable generator.  Window placed AC only operates when the generator is turned on.  A stand up fan will circulate the air through the boathouse quite nicely. You must bring your own towels.  Beds have mattress covers, pillow with cover and simple bed spread.  We do not have a refrigerator on the boat, so you may want to bring good coolers.  Ice can be purchased at the marina.  Water level is pretty deep around the house, so you must bring your own life jackets. Paddle boat and kayak are on site for your enjoyment.  If you love camping this is the place for you.  If bugs bother you and you’re not use to being out in the wilderness, well you may want to rethink this option.  Basic necessities such as dish soap, toilet paper, & paper towels are provided.  You may want to bring extra paper plates. Lake water from the sinks are not suitable for drinking.  Please bring your own bottled water.  Shower water is directly from the lake, so it may emit a well water type odor. Also the shower does not have hot water.  Water temp will vary from the beginning of the season to the end of the season.  Our little houseboat is a perfect getaway for those wanting some rest and relaxation.  Nothing like waking up with a cup of coffee in hand and seeing the sunrise in the morning on the lake.",
    "access": "For safety reasons please do not climb the rear ladder onto the roof.  Jumping off the roof into the water is dangerous and you can get injured which would ruin your vacation.  We sincerely appreciate if you honor our policy.  Thank you.",
    "notes": "Although there is a ladder, please do not climb it and get on the roof.  For safety reasons climbing on the roof to dive off is not permitted.  We would sincerely appreciate you not even attempting to go on the roof.",
    "interaction": "We have our personal house boat nearby and will be available should you need anything.",
    "house_rules": "You must be at least 21 years old in order to book and stay at our place.

A small trash can is provided for used toilet paper etc. Portable generator stored Inside the boathouse must be moved outside and connected with a main cable (provided) in order to run AC ,fan, and microwave.

Please bring your own life vest especially for small children.  Lastly, please do not climb the ladder at the rear of the boat onto the roof.  For safety reasons, getting on the roof to dive into the water is forbidden.         Our no pet policy is put in place so that we can maintain our houseboat as clean as possible. Although your pet may be well trained at home, pets react differently when in a new environment such as out in the water with boats passing close by.  Please respect our no pet policy and if you show up with your pet you will not be allowed on the boat and we will gladly offer a full refund.",

We didn't find the floor as clean as we would like but that was easy to remedy. Host was very amenable and forthright with the broken hot tub and toilet once we got there. Upper deck views are stunning during the day and sunset but way too many spiders after dark! It was the most memorable stay we have ever had and all enjoyed!",

And the price was much less than any of the nearby hotels, that would have offered a lot less amenities. Most importantly of the Boathouse vs. a hotel:  the relaxed, at home feeling, and the setting can not be matched.  Keith is very friendly and accommodating.  We've told all of our family and friends about the Cypress Boathouse Retreat, because when my husband posted a video on social media, everyone wanted to know the details.",

Some key things for future guests: please use the beautiful bath house facility that is located at the end of the dock, rather than the toilet on the boat.  The bath house Josh had built  is very nice, and is kept very clean. Enjoy sunsets and time on the deck of the boat, it’s beautiful out on the water.  There’s a bunch of great places nearby to get out onto the lake, such as North Coast Beachfitters.  And the burgers were excellent at Dock’s Beach House, which was just down the street.

Unfortunately we had mayflies, but Josh was there every morning blowing them off and pressure washing the boat to make sure we were able to enjoy the outer decks. The boat had plenty of room for the 3 of us and there are lots of things to do in the area. The bath house is such a great idea and also the barge with the grill for cooking. I will come back again for sure! Michelle and Josh were so nice. Thank  you for a lovely weekend!",

Just like the first time around, we were super impressed with the great communication and especially the cleanliness of the houseboat.

    "summary": "(Boat #1 of 3) Enjoy the gentle sway of my newly renovated 1984 50' Jamestowner houseboat!  Please note, it can’t be removed from the marina slip and must stay attached to the dock.  The Volunteer Landing Marina is centrally located in downtown Knoxville with an abundance of restaurants, activities, and sightseeing closeby!  Knoxville Greenway walking and biking trail runs behind the marina.  Neyland Stadium and Thompson Boling area are in walking distance.  Pets w/approval and fee applies.",
    "space": "There is nothing like waking up and seeing the beautiful water right outside your window then sitting on the deck with a cup of coffee in the cool morning air!  Staying on a houseboat is different than a hotel room so please keep that in mind, but for those looking for a unique experience, it's truly special!  Practically everything in the houseboat has been renovated but I left interesting aspects such as the rustic ceiling beams and steering console.  It is a fun and different way to enjoy the beauty and experience of the water!  \nThe boat has a residential style heat pump for year round comfort that can be easily adjusted with a wall thermostat.  \n***This accommodation may not be suitable for young children due to proximity of water.\n\nI am happy to allow pets traveling with their families!  However, pets are permitted with approval only.  There is an additional $15/pet per day fee which can be paid at check in and may vary due to size and/or breed of pet.  I ask that pets are flea/tick free, not permitted on furniture or bedding, and not left alone when guests are away from the boat unless they are crate trained and not barking.  \n\n2022 South Bay Pontoon Boats available to rent from the marina! \nVisit the Volunteer Landing Marina website for rental information.",
    "access": "You'll have the entire houseboat to yourself!  \nCheck in times may be flexible if available.  Please contact me if you would like an earlier check in or later check out times.",
    "notes": "***Tennessee Volunteers home football gameday weekends require a 3 night minimum stay***\n\nThere are other guests at the marina and unfortunately I cannot control the noise or hours, but I do ask that you are considerate and not loud during dark hours. Parties are not permitted and this is strictly enforced.  Any guests visiting must be approved.  \nPets are permitted for responsible pet owners and approval and fee are required.\nGolf cart is available for transporting luggage to and from parking area.  It is shared between my other houseboat rentals so I ask that it not be left in the parking lot or kept out for extended periods of time.\nMinimum age for guests completing the reservation is 25.",
    "neighborhood": "Downtown Knoxville has so many things to offer!  Calhoun’s on the River and Ruths Chris are the closest restaurants but the heart of downtown including Market Square and Gay St are a short walk away or utilize the free downtown trolley that comes by the marina parking area.",
    "transit": "A golf cart is available for your use and is shared by my other houseboat rentals.  There is a marina loading and unloading zone very close by and guest parking is nearby as well.  I will do my best to meet you at check in to get you oriented and answer any questions you may have concerning parking.",
    "interaction": "I will meet you at check in and provide a golf cart for your use during your stay.  I’m happy to help with any questions you may have during your stay!",
    "house_rules": "*Children are permitted but I strongly advise parents to keep close eye on them at all times.  \n*Boat cannot be removed from the marina and must remain attached to the slip at all times.  \n*Absolutely NO parties or additional guests without host approval.  This is strictly enforced and guests may be asked to vacate without a refund if rules are not respected.  \n*Quiet hours are 10pm-7am.",

Roomier than an RV, the interior is just as pictured.  Free parking right next to the locked dock gate made it easy to unload bags/quickly store food in the large fridge. As there had been a thunderstorm earlier that afternoon, the water was a bit rough and made unlocking the padlocked front door an exercise in gymnastics (don't be wearing heels on the floating dock!) We didn't try the shower but the head-low seat and all-served its purpose. The marina restroom is ~200 steps away-a quick walk through the valeted parking lot of a restaurant that we didn't visit but sounded like a fun place.\nAt 5'8\" the bed was just long enough; the futon is large & long. We expected it to be chillier at night but it was quite comfortable to sleep with open windows in mid- June, & by 5am the water was so calm we couldn't believe we were on the Hudson. Amazing sunrise.",

Roomier than an RV, the interior is just as pictured.  Free parking right next to the locked dock gate made it easy to unload bags/quickly store food in the large fridge. As there had been a thunderstorm earlier that afternoon, the water was a bit rough and made unlocking the padlocked front door an exercise in gymnastics (don't be wearing heels on the floating dock!) We didn't try the shower but the head-low seat and all-served its purpose. The marina restroom is ~200 steps away-a quick walk through the valeted parking lot of a restaurant that we didn't visit but sounded like a fun place.\nAt 5'8\" the bed was just long enough; the futon is large & long. We expected it to be chillier at night but it was quite comfortable to sleep with open windows in mid- June, & by 5am the water was so calm we couldn't believe we were on the Hudson. Amazing sunrise.",

It was amazing to wake up on the river and see the sunrise from the deck. I was thankful for Nick's communication and attention to all the details, which made the stay comfortable. Everything was perfect, and I look forward to staying at this place again with my friends in the future. Thank you so much for everything!",

Anyone with mobility issues may find getting on and around the houseboat challenging.  Easy parking, friendly marina staff and generally quiet esp at night, though it may be different during the height of the season. I appreciated the extras offered by Nick (coffee, sugar, spices etc.) Neighboring villages nice to visit and walk as well,  just a short car ride away.",

It's located in a marina behind an exceptional seafood restaurant that was very busy for the weekend, but fortunately we were able to order takeout and enjoy our food on the boat. We saw lots of wildlife right outside (including a rare night heron). Beds are comfortable and the gentle rocking made for a great night's sleep. Nick is a very responsive host and he made our visit easy and enjoyable. A great place for a peaceful and unusual stay. We will be going back for sure.",

    "summary": "This 60ft yacht can be yours for a day, a night, a week or a month. She features three staterooms, 2 full baths, outdoor showers, and a full-beam mid-ship master suite. Perfect for week long trips or long weekends  to the keys or the Bahamas with two couples or a family.  \n\nAlso great for day trips!\n\nThe Airbnb fees are only to stay overnight. \n\nPricing to take the boat out.\n\n4 hrs $2300\n6 hrs $2600\n8 hrs $2800\nPlus tip for crew (typically20%). \n\nAsk about our pricing  for longer trips",
    "space": "Why stay in a hotel, house or condo when you can stay on a yacht that has 3 bedrooms and accommodates 6 overnight while you island hop in the Bahamas or cruise around the Miami/ Fort Lauderdale  area. \n\nPlease note you can not stay on the boat while it is docked at its home port marina. Airbnb's are not allowed there. For guests that want to stay on-board there will be additional costs to move the boat to another marina inclusive of captain fee, and dock fee and subject to slip availability. Please reach out with questions. \n\nWe can accommodate up to 12 for day charters. Perfect for going to the sand bars. Hang out in the water with our water pad and just have a blast. \n\nWe pick up and drop off at Duffy's and can also pick up and drop off at other locations at the charterers expense.",
    "notes": "A qualified captain, along with a stew/mate will need to be hired and are not included. We will provide you with a list of great captains and stews. You will chose your own crew. Fuel at idle speed is included for short local trips. You will need to pay for your own fuel usage for any trips out in the ocean or where the boat will be traveling at cruising speeds. An additional cleaning fee of $360 will be charged for each charter and is included in the Airbnb fees. Your stew/host will provide you with a five-star experience. Prepare food, shop for you, clean, serve and act as you VIP host during your charter. They also help the captain with everything on the boat. Please note in order to book a charter we will need at least 7 days of advance notice to guarantee the availability of the crew. If you give shorter notice than that we will still try our best to accommodate, but we won’t be able to guarantee availability. \n\nIn order to use the jet-ski you must have prior jet-ski experience and demonstrate that and prove that for the insurance company. You must also have a Florida boating safety certificate. You can take the course online prior to your trip if you don't have one. The Jetski is rented separately at $150 an hour and fuel is not included. If you drink you will not be allowed to use the jetski. \n\nOh and don't forget to tip the crew if they do a great job. It is customary to give the crew a 15-20% gratuity on charters, similar to a restaurant.",
    "neighborhood": "Boat is located in a very safe gated and secured area. The boat is docked in a private marina next to homes and some neighbors that stay on their yachts. As such all loading and unloading will be done at Duffy's in North Miami unless otherwise agreed to. No pets please.",
    "transit": "Uber and Lyft work great here.",
    "interaction": "I am always available by phone. Please text or call with any questions whatsoever.",
    "house_rules": "1)  No more than 12 guests aboard. \n\n2) Shoes off! There is basket when you first walk into the boat to keep shoes. \n\n3) Have fun\n\n4) No Smoking\n\n5) Don't touch any buttons or controls without asking.\n\n6) DO NOT THROW ANYTHING IN THE TOILET THAT DOESN'T COME OUT OF YOUR BODY. You can only throw very special marine biodegradable toilet paper in the toilet. Nothing else or you will break the system and it isn't cheap to fix. \n\n7) There is a standard cleaning fee of $180 for the interior and $180 for the exterior. \nWe will charge an additional cleaning fee when the boat is left needing extra attention.\n\n8)You will need to sign a separate charter agreement and liability waiver.\n\n9) The jet-ski can only be used by experienced operators with a Florida Boating Safety Certificate. If you don't have one go online and take the course prior to your trip.  \n\n10) If you drink you can not use the jet-ski or any other water toys. NO EXCEPTIONS.\n\n11) There is one security camera in the living room above the TV facing the exterior door. This is there for security purposes. The camera is secured with Velcro so please feel free to put it in a drawer or just face it down during the duration of your stay and please remember to put it back in place when you leave. Thank you.\n\n12) Please report anything that is broken immediately.",

The boat itself beautifully decorated, clean, and just a joy to stay on for this trip. The upper deck overlooking the Riverwalk made for fun people watching and beautiful sunsets. Marcia was extremely responsive the 2 times I needed to reach out for minor issues. Highly recommend!",

    "summary": "Welcome to The Cove, Wilmington's most unique vacation rental community. \nFloating atop the Cape Fear River, Houseboat Luxe will offer you an experience unlike any you've had before. \nFrom the gentle rocking of the river, to the peaceful view of the sunset, a stay at The Cove is sure to leave you feeling refreshed, restored, and wanting to return again soon.",
    "space": "Using our detailed directions, you'll make your way to the Riverwalk, into the gated Marina, and down the floating dock to find your new version of paradise.\n\nSecured with dock ties and connected to electricity and water, you'll quickly realize that this is the luxurious version of a boat you didn't know you've always wanted.\n\nUpon entering Houseboat Lux, you'll be surrounded by soothing, water-inspired colors alongside our signature gold accents. As you open the sliding glass door you'll likely notice how spacious the open concept kitchen/dining/living area is and think to yourself, \"I should have brought more friends!\" (Don't worry, there's always next time.) With dining seating for 7, living room seating for 5, and a fully stocked kitchen, you could actually host your next Thanksgiving here.\n\nMoving past the kitchen, you'll find your way into the first floor bathroom, which features a walk-in shower, toilet, sink stocked with some essentials, and full size washer and dryer. Just through the lockable pocket door is the first floor bedroom, which has a Queen bed, large closet, 40\" Smart TV, and access door to the small back patio, which is a great spot for some quiet reading or meditation.\n\nAs you make your way up the staircase, you'll find another large living area with a sofa bed, loveseat, 60\" Smart TV, and a beautiful view through the sliding glass door. Stepping outside, you'll find yourself on a large patio featuring an outdoor sink, mini fridge, and a dining table with four chairs overlooking the Cape Fear River. This patio is a fan favorite for everything from morning coffee, afternoon reading, evening spirits, and even some yoga. (It's truly that big!) In the Summer months, you'll often hear live music coming from Marina Grill, our delicious on-site restaurant, or Live Oak Bank Pavilion Amphitheater, which is only a block away.\n\nHeading back inside, you'll walk through the living room to find the second floor bedroom, featuring a King bed, dresser, large closet & 55\" Smart TV. The lockable pocket door connects you to the second floor bathroom, which offers another walk-in shower, toilet and large sink space. Once you curl up in bed, the dimmable lights,  well insulated walls (for both noise and temperature), ceiling fan, and gentle rocking of the river are sure to provide you an excellent night of sleep. \n\nLocation:\n\nHouseboat Lux is located in the Port City Marina, which sits on the North end of the award-winning Riverwalk in Downtown Wilmington. Just a few steps from the Wilmington Convention Center and one block from both The Wilson Center, and Live Nation's Live Oak Bank Pavilion Amphitheater, The Cove offers the perfect solution for those wanting to avoid the chaos of parking, event traffic, and needing a DD.\n\nLess than a mile away you'll find the heart of Historic Downtown Wilmington. Whether you choose to stroll along the Riverwalk, take the free trolley, or drive a few blocks down Water Street, making your way into Downtown will be easy. With many local shops, restaurants, breweries, museums, live music, and events, there is always something for everyone to enjoy. Check out Wilmington and Beaches online for more info about local events.\n\nBeyond the borders of Downtown, a quick 8 minute drive or Uber ride will get you to the Wilmington International Airport (ILM), and within a 10 mile radius you'll find Wrightsville Beach, Jungle Rapids amusement/water park, UNCW (Go Seahawks!) and so much more.\n\nIf you're interested in bringing your boat, our friends at Port City Marina would love to rent you a slip! Please reach out to them directly to coordinate that for the dates of your stay.\n\nIf this houseboat is not available during your preferred time frame, please check out the listings for our other houseboats at The Cove, and don't hesitate to reach out for assistance.",
    "access": "Guests have access to the entire houseboat for the duration of their stay.",
    "neighborhood": "Port City Marina (PCM) is a gated, full-service, deep water marina featuring over 200 state-of-the-art floating concrete wet slips. Uniquely located on the Cape Fear River, PCM hosts everything from transient boaters to our permanent houseboat community. \n\nThough they are currently scattered among the docks, we are excited that our permanent dock, which is being custom built specifically for our houseboats, will be completed in Spring of 2023. This dock will feature angled slips, beautiful landscaping, and a community space at the end of the dock.",
    "transit": "Free parking is provided for one vehicle per houseboat. Our parking lot is located about 1,000 feet from the Marina, so we recommend packing in suitcases with wheels if you have them, and bringing an umbrella or rain jacket. \n\nIf you will have more than one car, you can park in one of the two paid parking garages located diagonally from our parking lot. (Pier 33 apartments or Wilmington Convention Center)",
    "house_rules": "Please help us maintain a clean and safe space for all guests by respecting our houseboat rules listed above.\nFailure to abide by these rules may result in additional fees.",

    "neighborhood": "Port City Marina is a gated, full-service, deep water marina featuring over 200 state-of-the-art floating concrete wet slips. Uniquely located on the Cape Fear River, PCM hosts everything from transient boaters to our permanent houseboat community.",
    "transit": "Free parking is provided for one vehicle per villa. Our parking lot is located about 1,000 feet (4 min walk) from the Marina, so we recommend packing in suitcases with wheels if you have them, and bringing an umbrella or rain jacket. \n\nIf you will have more than one car, you can park in one of the two paid parking garages located diagonally from our parking lot. (Pier 33 apartments or Wilmington Convention Center)",

She is a remarkable hostess and knows how to execute the details to perfection. She even checked in with us prior to a heavy rainstorm to make sure we knew she'd be available in case we needed support.

The houseboat was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING and so much open area to move freely around. The houseboat is so large, and yet, with such warm and thoughtful touches and decorating, it feels cozy and inviting. As far as the \"housekeeping \" Angie goes WAY BEYOND most places to ensure that EVERYTHING is absolutely IMMACULATE. The place was spotless, and yet Angie absolutely encourages you to make yourself at home.  We were greeted by Angie with a warm welcoming smile, and she took time to go over everything so our stay would be optimal. I was somewhat unsure about how everything would function on a foreign houseboat to me/ my family,  but again,  Angie has thought of EVERYTHING and it SO SUPER EASY to stay there & just relax & have a great time. Do NOT second guess this rental, Angie and her houseboat are both INCREDIBLE!!",

The house was modest but perfect. \n\nPauline was responsive and helpful whenever we needed something. \n\nThis place has quickly become one of our favorites. We will be returning every year during the summer. Can’t wait to go back .\n\nHighly Recommended!",

When we arrived the host had a bottle of sparkling wine waiting for us and a list of recommendations for great local restaurants and coffee shops. We were within 10 to 30 minutes of all the activities we wanted to enjoy. At the property you can picnic under the big ash tree, canoe/kayak, swim, fish, have a bonfire, birdwatch, read a good book, play board games, and most of all enjoy the beautiful Cayuga Lake view! So peaceful!",

Pauline was a wonderful host - very responsive and kind. We made great use of the kitchen for nearly all our meals and ate dinner out on the picnic table nightly. We didn't use the canoe b/c it seemed like it would be difficult to maneuver in/out of the water, but we enjoyed swimming in the lake very much. It's a bit shallow at that end, but that was fine by us. The porch windows don't open, which meant it was uncomfortably warm to sit in there on warm, sunny days. The house also warms up quickly and retains heat, but the air conditioners quickly cool it down if need be.  Local restaurant and grocery recommendations were helpful and we enjoyed Sauders, the Mennonite grocery, very much. Great deli meats among many other interesting items.",

We LOVED drinking our morning coffee while watching the sunrise and seeing the Osprey and other birds fish at dusk. We took the canoe out for a spin around the lake during a cloud-covered day and enjoyed using my inflatable paddle board during the better weather. We also enjoyed exploring historic Seneca Falls and trying out the local haunts. Thanks for a great stay!",

My only negative feedback is that it was very hot and the AC did not work very well, but it was an unusually hot 90° weather day. But again we had a wonderful time and our five -year-old daughter really enjoyed the experience! The separate bedroom and pull out couch was also very nice with 3 people.",

Otherwise put all trash in the cans on the side of the house.\n\nMake sure ALL dishes are washed and put away before final departure day. Leaving them clean in the dishwasher is NOT put away.\n\nLeave beds as is. I wash room by room. If sofa sleepers were used you can strip those and put in the laundry room.\n\nPut all used towels in the laundry basket.\n\nSet thermostat to 79 degrees cool before leaving. DO NOT EVER USE EMERGENCY HEAT SETTING.\n\nTHANK YOU FOR FOLLOWING OUR RULES TO KEEP OUR HOME NICE FOR EACH GUEST WHO STAYS AT OUR RELAXING RIVER HOME.\n\nBE PREPARED TO PAY OUR MARION COUNTY LOCAL TAX. AIRBNB DOES NOT COLLECT THIS AND IT WILL BE AN ADDITIONAL COST ABOVE WHAT YOU PAY TO AIRBNB. Based on 2023 tax rate a 3 night stay would be approx $44 - 5 night stay would be approx $70. To be collected by Lisa Rice.",

The accommodations were great, everything one needed was available.  Loved the bohemian vibe .  Will definitely be planning another stay.",

We didn’t really know when we would arrive, but luckily check-in was very flexible and stress-free. The boat had the best spot in the marina! In the mornings, we would have a cup of coffee and sit out on the patio watching the dolphins splash around. We made friends with so many other local residents of the marina which made our trip even more exciting. I would highly recommend visiting!",

This houseboat AirBB – was very clean, well-stocked with supplies and appliances, and had beautiful views of the space launches.  We were surprised by how spacious both the kitchen and the bathroom were.  The washer/dryer came in very handy since we were there for a month.  The boat is a charming space with a lovely dock path to walk around the marina/resort to take in the surroundings.  Being directly on the canal between the Indian River and Banana River, our morning coffee and breakfast was enjoyed most mornings on the bow deck where an occasional manatee or a pod of dolphins would pass by.  Jacqui and her team were excellent hosts in greeting us at the beginning and checking in on us from time to time during our stay! We are already looking forward to next years stay!  Thanks, Jacqui, for a fantastic stay!",

    "summary": "A \"floating\" vacation on my 62x14 ft Sumerset Houseboat offering comforts of home while gazing at the ever changing waterscape.  Boats of all sizes and descriptions plus dolphins will pass by your front porch all day long.  If you're seeking an experience, something different,  but in a tranquil relaxing more private setting, you found it.  Pura Vida will stay at dock during stay, will not leave dock.",
    "space": "Park right next to Pura Vida, my one bedroom houseboat.  Steps down to the dock and a few more steps down to enter onto your covered front porch (bow) with direct water view.  Have your morning coffee, dine or just relax in your recliner while watching nature, dolphins and the myriad of boats pass by.  The boat will slightly sway once in awhile, which I find soothing. Don't forget to waive, as boaters are a very friendly lot. Located in the best spot in the marina with direct waterfront view and no boats in front or either side of you.  You are on the Indian River lagoon between the Indian River (Intercoastal waterway) and the Banana River.  Space Coast rocket launches right in front of the bow.  Boats entering or leaving the marina will pass you by on your starboard (right) side. \n\nStep into your very comfortable living room and (hopefully) smile at my boho/vintage/contemporary vibes.   Sofa is a brand new queen sleeper.  Dining area sitting four directly across from your full  kitchen with a four burner gas range, full size fridge/freezer and new quartz counter tops.  No dishwasher, but if more than two of you, try paper/plastic plates. All new flooring, paint, ceiling fan, counter tops and window blinds.  If you have to work, cubby around the corner with desk/chair. Small but sufficient bath, but try hard not to drop the soap in shower, as it's the same size as a typical RV shower.  As we are a boat, we provide marine grade toilet tissue throughout your stay.  Please don't use any other.  Few more steps into your private bedroom with queen bed and and a makeup table or second work area. Small combo washer/dryer in a closet, but recommend very small loads or clothes will look wrinkly, but I do provide a small handheld steamer, if needed. Glass door leading out to your rear covered porch (stern) with a small bistro table and two chairs for when you want to feel part of the marina.   Climb the stairs to your second covered living room with two sofas, chairs, and a 55\" Smart TV.  Two  swinging chairs coming soon with photo to follow.  If you want more privacy, drop down the Isinglass, which also keeps wind out for cooler days.  Want a tan, step out to the open area for relaxing on the two loungers and catch some rays.  Be sure to come down the stairs same way you go up; face the steps.  There are a few walls with \"wrinkly\" areas, which will be replaced in the spring.  The marina is not part of the resort, so there is no access to the resort's pool or clubhouse. I think you will find that staying on Pura Vida will be a very fun, unique and rewarding experience.   As Pura Vida is my  home, she will only be available for a few months of the year:  Feb. thru mid-April and again June thru mid-Aug.    No reviews yet, as I'm just now making her available for you to enjoy.",
    "access": "Enjoy the entire houseboat except the basement for my storage.",
    "notes": "For the safety of toddlers and small children, I don't recommend,  unless you are watching constantly.  Too easy for them to fall overboard.  Unfortunately, my boat can not accommodate a wheel chair.",
    "neighborhood": "Leisure walk around the marina perimeter to Dolphins tiki style restaurant/bar  and Cape Crossing boat rentals.  Mention you're staying on Pura Vida for a discount for their many water craft including SUPs.  Short walk to the dumpster for emptying trash and a little further to the marina office for complimentary full size washer & dryer.",
    "transit": "Approximately 35 min. east of Orlando International airport, eight miles north on Courtney to Kennedy Space Center and ten min. east to Cocoa Beach and it's beautiful sandy beaches. Park your vehicle right next to Pura Vida.  If larger wash loads, free larger size washer/dryers just down the short road to Marina office.",

The people at the Marina were family 'like' as well, very helpful, friendly, & cool folks as well (of course, they have boats in the marina)!! The grocery mart right outside the marina entrance, though a little small, had everything a big grocery would have & good prices as well, very convenient.  Grateful for Ambrose & Florence sharing their cute boathouse in this way, I'll always cherish the stay!! Rick from Tonawanda NY",

    "summary": "NOTE: DO NOT SUBMIT a \"Reservation Request\" on Airbnb until YOU HAVE MESSAGED US FIRST to say hi. Thanks!\n\nRelax not by the water but on the water with lots of fresh air, lots of sun, and a 7 minute walk to the beach. \nFreja is a 1970 Nautaline, 34' by 12' wide. This is a cabin on the water. It isn't fancy. Bathrooms/hot showers are on land about a 2 minute walk. Bring your own sheets/towels.\nThere are pillows/blankets but a sleeping bag is best.\nSorry, we don't rent to people with kids/pets.",
    "space": "Freja is a 34' Nautaline and she's been our home away from home for 9 years now. We love her dearly and would like that all guests treat her with respect. She is 52 years old and has quite a number of quirks. To be clear, do not expect a pristine, hotel-like experience. Staying on Freja is a lot like \"glamping\" on the water. There is a small fridge, microwave and a toaster oven and basic dishes, cups, silverware. Stove does not work at the moment. There is a sink on board, and we use a gallon water jug to do the dishes that is filled on the dock. The main bed is long and narrow and roughly full size, so big enough for two. There is smaller bed for humans under 5'10\"  in the pilot house. You need to bring your own sheets, pillowcases and towels. A sleeping bag is best. There is one space heater and a fan. The bathrooms and hot showers are on land near the marina office, a two minute walk down the dock",
    "access": "The berth below the pilot house is off limits as well as the closet leading to the space. Thanks.",
    "notes": "You must bring your own sheets (full size), pillowcases and towels. There are two pillows for sleeping but feel free to bring your own, ours are well used.\n DO NOT use the toilet onboard in any circumstance! Please only use the toilets on land by the marina office.\nThere is no WiFi but great cell service so your hotspot will work fine.\nWe ask that you treat Freja with respect and love.",
    "neighborhood": "There is a small grocery store right outside the marina and a huge Stop and Shop a 15 minute walk or short bike ride. The beach is a 5 minute walk. If you don't want to cook there are several restaurants near by. Rippers beach bar on the boardwalk at and the Rockaway Surf Club are not to be missed.",
    "transit": "If you have a car, there is ample parking. Or bring your bike. Otherwise take the A train to Beach 60th st. and it is a 2 minute walk to the marina",
    "interaction": "We won't be there, she's all yours. Feel free to text or call with any questions.",
    "house_rules": "Our boat is suitable for only one or two people to stay. Sorry no kids. \nPlease be respectful of our neighbors and other boat owners. Absolutely no parties.",

I was trying to find something last minute that was available & a decent price.  I found the houseboat & began looking into it.  I have been going up to the islands since I was little and always stayed at hotels or cottages. I  thought staying on a houseboat would be a fun & different experience.  After our stay I asked him if we could do another weekend on one this summer.  The check in was easy & the owners were very helpful with any questions we had or if we needed help with anything.  The interior was decorated nicely; they had coffee and little snacks available.  We slept amazing. The king size bed was super comfy & the ac kept us nice and cool all night.  I loved that they had seating on top of the boat and at the entrance.  It was nice to sit on top and have coffee in the morning and enjoy a nice view.   ",

We enjoyed the open bright space and beautiful balcony overlooking the lake. We also were able  to use the Muskoka chairs on the dock to enjoy the afternoon. When we arrived and met Lyn she was helpful in showing all the features of her accommodation and all the items (dock, kayak, SUP) for guests. She was always around for any questions we had. The boathouse is in an exceptional location in a lovely quiet area but very close to places such as Bala and Port Carling. When visiting the area again we would love to stay again at Lyn’s boathouse and would highly recommend to anyone visiting the area on a getaway to Muskoka.",

Winters are spent in Boston.\n2019 the river water was very high, over our docks to above our knees!, so we could not host guests at all.  \nBack to hosting summer of 2020\n",

As travelers, we discovered that not everyone thinks of the \"little\" things that are important to a traveler. Judy and John have thought of those things.

Newport is certainly about the boats and the bay, and being right out there, kayaking easily over to the Newport shipyard, and around Goat Island was just wonderful. There are a number of great restaurants in easy walking distance. We were here for the folkfest and that was also an easy bike ride!  The place itself is a very cool, refurbished, old houseboat with charm and very comfortable. We used all the outdoor spaces for coffee and drinks at various times.   Climbing the ladder to the second floor was no problem for us and the breeze was just fine without air conditioning.  We hope to stay there again.",

Kathy made sure we knew she was available at all times and was very approachable is we needed anything. The house boat itself was everything the listing said and more, even with so many delicious restaurants around we felt more at home sitting on back deck of the boat sharing delicious food we prepared on the boat with the amazing view of the marina. It was the perfect family getaway.",

It’s over $10 for the first 10 minutes, $20 for after 20 minutes!  When I started seeing charges sent by text for parking, I was kinda freaked out by how quickly they were accumulating. So I messaged Mellisa.\n\nKeith 5:39 PM\nWith parking, we pulled straight into the marina parking.. do you know the price if we leave it there? Til Thursday morning, or is it an hourly thing?\nRead by Melissa\nMelissa 11:46 PM\nSorry just seeing this.\n\nAgain.. no help whatsoever. \n\nSo here’s the parking info fir the marina. There is a max charge per day in the marina. We pd $89 for parking from 5pm Tuesday to 9am Thursday morning",

    "notes": "Terms & Conditions: Bed & Breakfast Afloat vessels do differ from a standard hotel room and most people feel that this adds a certain charm and seaside ambiance to the accommodations. Please keep in mind that you will be staying on a boat and there will normally be some movement - most people find this very comforting.  The boats are spread throughout Constitution Marina and there will be a short walk to your Bed & Breakfast vessel.  If you have any mobility issues please contact us prior to booking your reservation. These are not Party Boats, if you wanted to have a small party we recommend that you inquire about one of our many charter vessels where you can enjoy a sunset cruise or visit one of the many Boston Harbor islands. You can also inquire in the office about renting the deck.\n\nCooking is not allowed on any of the Bed & Breakfast vessels.\n\nDue to insurance and concern for our customers' vessels, only as many people may visit you as are paying to stay overnight, i.e. two paying guests, two visitors; four paying guests, four visitors (no overnight visitors please).  Quiet time is from 11pm - 8am.  Dock staff has the right to ask you to vacate the boat if this rule is abused or if we have received reports of rowdiness.  Thank you in advance for your cooperation. \n\nAdditional fees may be charged for any damage, loss of property, or extra cleaning.\n\nPlease note that prices are subject to change and special event rates may apply.\n\nCHECK-IN: May: 3pm - 6pm | June - August: 3pm - 8pm | September - October: 3pm - 6pm\n\nPARKING: Parking  for a fee is available nearby.",

From the ping-pong to the campfire to the dock (BIG coy fish and swans) to the hot tub to the work out room to the big TV to the game room; there was always something going on with lots of space to do it in.  Smith Point beach is a half hour including a stop to get ice, drinks and snacks.  Cook dinner on the deck or run down to Patchogue for wonderful dining options. Caroline (and Scott) are great hosts and go out of their way to accommodate you in all ways.  Alexa is always ready.\nThe house is well appointed with a great balance between modern electronics and that vintage house character and charm.  We actually celebrated 2 birthdays there in a twice  decorated large dining room.  Everything is clean, well-maintained  and amenities are well thought out with 2 (two) big bathtubs/showers and lots of towels.  There are little solar lights everywhere for walking around at night to hear the raucous crickets and see the moonlight on the river.  Tip:  back into the driveway, or, turn around once in so that you can drive out.",

Caroline & Scott have done an amazing job of updating the home with modern touches (light switches, bathrooms) while preserving the historical character (doors, windows, built ins). We even spotted 2 beautiful swans in the river behind the house. They had almost everything one might need for cooking and provided detailed instructions in a manual for the home. \n\nTips for future guests: if you have heavier items or rolling suitcases, pull up in front of the house to wheel in on the stone path; the driveway is pebbles and there’s no paved path to the door; be careful walking on the street, esp at night—the cars drive fast; if you want to workout in the basement, turn the space heater on a little while before you want to be down there so it’s not too cold;  the heat defaults down to 66 F automatically, so it can get chilly—consider bringing warm clothing and slippers; the refrigerator & freezer are drawers and it’s very easy to not close them all the way, and they will beep until they are closed.",

The outside grounds include a newly added fire pit, plus a wonderfully decorated small reading nook and a barn with foosball, ping pong and couch to hang out. Our family favorite is spending time at the boathouse on the river, feeding the swans that visit each day. It is an easy trip to many cute towns nearby, but if you stay here you may feel like we do - we never want to leave!",

What a fabulous way to explore one of the most beautiful areas. If you are planning on sleeping six on one of the red boats, you will need to all really like each other and have the ability to sleep in close quarters. As it was, we were just the two of us, and it was perfect!",

I am honestly both blown away and heartbroken at the same time, the latter because I had to check out of this beautiful home located in a breathtaking location! \nIn Upstste NY, there are quite a few waterfront rentals, but NONE of them compare to this amazing property! I absolutely LOVED how this home is directly on the water! The views from every window are spectacular! \nThe home is spotless and decorated so beautifully- both inside and out. We felt right at home for our stay and verything we could have wanted was there. \nNicole was very quick to respond and incredibly helpful and kind. She made sure everything was perfect for our stay.\nWe had the perfect birthday getaway here! The water, amazing location, beautiful surroundings, the tranquility and peacefulness of it all made it so we never had to leave! (And we didn't want to either!) \nWe definitely want to make the trip here an annual birthday thing, but next year stay for a longer time! Incredible isn't a strong enough word!",

It is piped directly from the lake and that’s what’s in the shower and the faucets so for cooking and brushing teeth you use bottled water. We were also warned about the small septic tank and provided with paper plates and plastic silverware to cut down on water use. This made the kitchen more useful for warming premade meals, sandwiches, cereal, picnic fare but not really a place to do serious cooking . This worked out for us but it is good to be forewarned.",

Wayne was a great host and met me at the dock to show me the boat with a nice cart to get my stuff to the boat. He also left muffins, juice and k-cups.\n\nOne note on the bed situation. It is bunk over bunk, so whomever has the top bunk has a private room, but that is also where the only bathroom is located and the door with which we entered the boat. That bed is also very high!  So, think fancy royal beds!\n\nThe bottom bed is down three stairs from the top bed and the mattress is on the floor (which is why the top bed is high - you’re under the that bed!)  I slept down there and was very cozy!  But I’m glad it was just me and one other female, because of my needing to go into her room to use the bathroom at night.\n\nJust wanted to explain the beds, but we loved everything else about the boat!  We’d both rent it again!",

Being an avid water bug, I came up with the idea of sharing my experience of staying on the water with others like you. Walker's Retreat is my home away from home.  Having been in Real Estate since moving here, I would love to give you first hand knowledge of the attractions and things to do here in Naples. From restaurants recommendations, to exciting and fun water activities, entertainment, events, or just chilling out, I would love to direct you. Lets have fun.  Come see me. ",

For something different I highly recommend it. Easy walking distance to everywhere in downtown Naples. I plan to be back.",

The upper veranda was our favorite spot from dawn to dusk with ample seating and bay views of both the sunrise and sunset. Walker is a true southern gentleman and by far the most attentive and friendly host. There was so much to do and see within a short distance. Walker even recommended a stunning restaurant for our final evening in Naples. A truly fantastic stay from a couple who have rented Airbnbs from around the world. We look forward to returning soon!",

Also a terrible smell from the papermill that's in the area..  Kevin was out of town for truck repairs so his wife Karen did her best in explaining the features of the houseboat.  She was delightful and even gave us her phone number just in case we had any questions.\nThank you",

The game room was a perfect getaway for the kids on the rainy day. The best part was no steps to the lake! We would stay again!",

We spent most of our time on the dock or on the expansive lawn. The boat house was well stocked with floaties and chairs, and there were plenty of paddle boards for us to cruise around on as well. \n\nThe house was perfect for our large group and I would not hesitate to come back in the future!",

    "space": "Tired of staying in the same old stuffy boring hotel room? So were we, so we decided to own our own Houseboat on the Tennessee River, where we could walk to just about everything. The “Moonlight Madness” is docked in the peaceful Volunteer Landing Marina in Knoxville. The marina is steps away from award winning “Ruth’s Chris” steakhouse and Calhoun’s On the River. You can walk to both as well as the Neyland Greenway, James White Greenway, Neyland Stadium, Thompson-Boling arena, University of Tennessee and the vibrant Market Street in Downtown Knoxville. We can accommodate 6 people in beds. We have 2 bedrooms, one king size bed in the master and a Full bed in the crew quarters and a queen size pull out couch, along with 2 bathrooms. We feature 3 decks, one off the bow, one off the stern (great for morning coffee or sun bathing ) and a 70' PARTY DECK on the roof. The party deck has abundant seating along with 2 flatscreen HD television and a gas grill. The master also has a 40' Vizio UHD flatscreen with Smartcast. The salon also has a 50' UHD flatscreen. Our boat comes fully stocked with clean linens and towels. The galley also comes fully stocked with dishes, utensils and small appliances along with Hi-Speed internet. You will meet a lot of very nice people that reside at the marina full time. Also, we have a EZGO golf cart and 2 Kayaks, 1 SUP and 2 beach cruiser bikes that are available for you to use while at our boat. Sorry but the Houseboat doesn't leave the marina slip however you can rent an easy to drive pontoon boat from the marina.",

This spot is absolutely spectacular and was the highlight of our weekend spent in Alexandria Bay. Not to mention, the views are stunning! (You can see Boldt Castle in the distance over the Marina). Nicholas, the host was very thorough in his instructions to get to the house and made check in and check out so easy and smooth. The house was absolutely spotless and fit 8 girls very comfortably. It was about a 4 minute car ride to the Alexandria Bay downtown core and only a 17 minute walk. We are so happy we chose the Harbor House for our girls trip and would definitely book this exact spot again!",

There's a place to dock your boat and some wonderful toys to play with. Kayaks, floats and the best little surprise was a clean life vest and raft for the little one to claim. \n We've been looking purposely for a lake home to purchase. Staying at Dwight's has given us another option. Perhaps we'll just rent his house a few more times a year.",

    "summary": "The Dragon is a 4-season houseboat moored at a private island in Manitou bay off the Gatineau River, accessed by boating 800m from our home parking. For winter, it returns to freeze into the ice 30m from our home parking, allowing access via foot.\n\nIn summer, the island will be yours alone, offering a unique opportunity to reconnect with nature and a loved one! The Dragon has solar power, as well as a propane cookstove, fridge and fireplace. \n\nWe provide several boat-in options described below:",
    "space": "'The Dragon' is an artisanal 4 season houseboat designed and built by a pirate in Wakefield, Qc. The boat now rests at a private island, along side a 40' dock on the Paugan reservoir of the Gatineau River, in the Manitou Bay. In the winter months, she is stationed 30m from our mainland home (in the ice!) to remain accessible throughout the year.\n\nThe living space is 24'x10' open concept, with patio doors on all sides, a propane fireplace for winter coziness, running water in the warm months, a mini fridge and 3 burner propane stove. \n\nThere is a queen size Ikea foam futon, with linens and towels provided. We also provide drinking water in 18L jugs.\n\nThere is a full size rooftop deck created for sunbathing and stargazing, a swimming ladder, and an outdoor metal fire bowl on the front patio, in the chest of the Dragon!\n\nOn the island there is an outdoor compost toilet. In winter you can use the bucket toilet in the boat, or place the bucket toilet on either exterior deck for use outside the main cabin. If our main house \"Manitou Cove\" is not rented during your visit you can use the shared basement bathroom with typical sink, toilet, and shower. Please ask us via Airbnb messaging if you are curious if you can use the house bathroom.\n\nThe island belongs to our friend and we ask that you treat the space like the sanctuary that it is, refraining from removing any natural vegetation or making fires.\n\nThere is plenty of wildlife to keep you company; blue herons, loons, beavers, ducks, bald head eagles, geese, deer, and on...\n\nThere is off grid 12V solar electricity for lights, sink pump and a USB charging port, but no 120V AC electricity. \n\nThere are essential kitchen utensils, plates, and cookware. Please inquire if you have particular requests.\n\nThere is good cell reception including data!\n\nWe welcome all questions~\n\n\nPlease choose from one of the following options for getting to the boat:\n\nA) 0$ extra: Bring your own motor boat or canoe to access the Dragon. Motor boats launch from one of two public boat launches 10km away. IF YOU ARE COMING WITH YOUR OWN CANOE OR NON-MOTORIZED BOAT, you are welcome to park at our home boat launch 800m from the Dragon. We provide a map via digital image.\n\nB) 50$ extra: Park at our home and rent our canoe.  We provide a map to the Dragon via digital image, as well as a labeled laminated map and compass in the canoe. It is around 800m or a 15-25 minute paddle from our parking to the Dragon.\n\nC) 120$ extra: Park at our home and book a round trip ferry ride on one of our motor boats, and rent our canoe for use during your stay. We coordinate a meeting time at our waterfront home parking, and drive you to the Dragon in one of our motor boats, leave you with a canoe, map and compass, and arrange a pickup time to come back and get you at the end of your stay.",

Our passion for Augusta and the outdoors shows in each of our properties in their own unique way and sometimes where you least expect it. We know what to do, where to eat and what to see here in the city so feel free to ask if you need some ideas. Other than outdoor recreation, we love to spend time with our two fur babies, keeping up with our backyard plants and volunteering time to a variety of different organizations around town. We’re excited to meet you and welcome you to one of our properties! ",

They also let us use their kayaks which was super fun! The place was gorgeous and watching the sunsets on the top deck as well as sitting on the back porch was our favorite part. The AC worked great and there was plenty of hot water. There are spiders and ants around the place but it wasn’t anything too bad. If you want to go somewhere that is fun with great views this is the place to go!",

    "summary": "The spacious Savannah Rea is docked first at the 5th Street Marina, just steps away from Downtown Augusta! Sitting directly on the Savannah River, the houseboat provides gorgeous views from inside your corridors or from one of three outdoor spaces including the 700 sq.ft. rooftop deck.",
    "space": "Bow and stern outdoor patios have seating for four and provide exceptional views of the Savannah River from sunrise to sunset. There is a charcoal grill on the back patio. \n\nRooftop deck has a 360’ view which includes views of Downtown Augusta, The Augusta Riverwalk, the iconic 1912 Southern Railroad Bridge and lastly, Augusta’s newest attraction, the Freedom Pedestrian Bridge. \n\nInside, the wet bar ties the living room, kitchen and dining area all together in one open space. The couch in the living room folds out to a full sized bed, high top table sits four, kitchen has microwave and refrigerator/freezer (THE STOVE/OVEN, DISHWASHER AND TRASH COMPACTOR ARE OUT OF USE) and wet bar has built-in ice-maker and countertop k-cup coffee maker. Behind the closet doors in the kitchen you’ll find a full use stacked washer/dryer with detergent and whitening pods which are under the sink. \n\nLarge bathroom has full sized walk in shower, high end marine toilet, three shelf vanity. \n\nQueen sized bedroom has fantastic large windows and back sliding glass door with back patio access. Multi-functional built in desk has plugs for computer charging. Left hand closet has robes, grilling accessories and vacuum.\n\nThe houseboat is cooled by a mini-split A/C system which includes two separate wall units, one in the living room and another in the bedroom. \n\nThe marina has a public Wi-Fi network which can be connected to throughout the houseboat.",
    "access": "The entire inside and outside of the houseboat are open for use. \n\nWe offer early check-in (12 NOON) and late check-out (1PM) for $35/occurrence. Availability is based on a first pay/first service basis and may not be available in all cases. ( i.e. guest pays $35 for a 1PM late check out, there would be no option for the next guest to pay $35 for an early 12 NOON check-in. ) We recommend that you request either or both when sending your initial introduction message upon booking.",
    "notes": "We don’t want any surprises when you arrive so these are the things to expect. \n\nGLAMPING - The only difference between the houseboat and a camper is the ground beneath, or lack there of. We throw the “Glam” in because this is glamping at its finest. \n\nSAVANNAH RIVER - We see many different species of wildlife both in and out of the water. Insects, reptiles, birds and fish will all make a presence here on the river. We spray the outside of the boat to minimize insects from intruding your space. Keeping the windows closed and closing the doors behind you, especially in the summer months will also help tremendously. \n\nFISHING - We do not supply any fishing gear but Walmart (less than 10 minutes away) has a full fishing department. Fishing is ONLY allowed off the boat itself, not the dock. Visit Georgia’s Department of Natural Resources website to purchase a fishing license and to read all rules and regulations before casting your line. \n\nMARINE TOILET - We have a zero tolerance policy for any kind of waste to enter the river. The toilet used on the boat is very high end and is nearly identical to the one used at your home. We supply the bathroom with marine grade toilet paper which is the only thing besides waste that should be flushed. A $400 charge applies to any waste system failure that is caused by any prohibited object or thing you flush. \n\nSECURITY CAMERAS - We have a Ring security system installed throughout the dock space to monitor our kayaking business, specifically the kayaks themselves, our storage spaces, the gas pump and the associated dock space. It records 120 seconds of both video and audio when it detects any motion. THIS MEANS THAT EACH TIME YOU, ADDITIONAL GUESTS OR VISITORS PASS THROUGH, YOU/THEY WILL BE RECORDED. \n\nPETS & ADDITIONAL GUESTS - We love fur babies! We have two of our own and they go with us everywhere we go! As long as they are accounted for on the reservation, we would love for your pup(s) to stay aboard. PLEASE BE AWARE THAT THE ENTIRE PERIMETER OF THE HOUSEBOAT HAS OPEN RAILINGS AND FIVE ENTRY/EXIT POINTS THAT ONLY HAVE A ROPE ACROSS THEM. DO NOT LEAVE THEM UNATTENDED WHILE OUTSIDE. We TOTALLY GET that accidents happen when dogs are in spaces that they are not used to. We'll say this again, WE TOTALLY GET IT. Please send us a message via AirBnB Inbox if there are any bathroom accidents and/or stomach accidents that occur so we can make sure they are attended to right away. Like many others, we do not enjoy foul smells and/or stains on carpets or linens so we would like to ask you for a few minutes while you are on-board for us to shampoo rugs and/or change any linens out if they are spoiled in anyway.  NO OTHER TYPE OF PET IS ALLOWED ONBOARD. We encourage you to invite any friends or family aboard during your stay but ask you to send us a message via AirBnB Inbox to give us a heads up if there will be a total of 5 or more people (max 10) on the boat at any given time. Only the amount of guests that are associated with your reservation are allowed to spend the night.",
    "neighborhood": "The marina property is a well-lit space that accommodates the general public 24 hours a day. Parking is free throughout for both visitors and residents and has handicap spaces that are designated by sign. You will notice that the terrace in front of the gift shop has open seating for the public to use. \n\nThe dock space that the houseboat is docked at, is the same dock space that we run our kayaking business on so you will more than likely see us at some point during your stay!",
    "transit": "15 MINUTE DRIVE TO AUGUSTA NATIONAL GOLF COURSE\n\nParking - Free and open! Once you’ve entered the marina, you’ll make your way to the parking lot at the bottom of the hill. You’ll see the Riverside Cafe’ food truck and 5th Street Marina gift shop. \n\nRidesharing - Uber and Lyft are both available throughout the entire Augusta metropolitan area. \n\nDowntown Access - Easily get to any of Downtown Augusta with a few steps, or a less than five-minute drive. The Riverwalk starts under the railroad bridge, follows the GORGEOUS Savannah River and ends at 10th Street. There is an upper and lower trail, the upper is much easier to walk (except climbing the staircase) and is recommended to use at nighttime. The lower is more of a walking trail but allows you to see our rivers unique wildlife up close. DO NOT ENTER THE WATER FROM THE RIVERWALK AND DO NOT FEED THE WILDLIFE.",
    "interaction": "We prefer to communicate through the AirBnB app and usually respond to any inquiries within 15 minutes. If you need us immediately feel free to call!",
    "house_rules": "No guests and/or visitors 12 years old are permitted on the houseboat. No one is permitted to be on the section of the rooftop deck that covers the lower front porch. No jumping off the boat into the river.",

Christhian was very responsive and helpful getting us to the location. We enjoyed local restaurants, having a beer on the boat deck afterwards, and getting rocked to sleep in a very comfortable bed! In the morning we had French press coffee in the sunshine on deck while watching the world wake up. 10/10, would visit again!",

The boat is super comfortable, very charming, peaceful, and it's just nice to be right on the water but close to everything else.  Cristhian is exceptionally good at communication and offers little touches like a very reasonably priced mini-bar with convenient necessities onboard.  We would most certainly look to stay here again when we come back to the Baltimore area!",

Quick to respond and quick to help if need be! \n\nOverall, the place was beautiful and worth the amount we paid for it, we had a great time. But there were a lot of bugs inside, a slight musty smell, a poor shower light, and a little hot at night time.",

    "summary": "The brand new, contemporary, 200 square foot boathouse, sits directly over water - you can actually hear the gentle sounds of the water beneath you. Amazing water views can be seen out of the two 8x8 foot sliding doors. There is a queen sized bed, small couch, kitchenette and mini split with heat/AC in the living space.",
    "space": "The boathouse is located in our backyard and we have neighbors on both sides.  There is no running water (although water is supplied). The boat garage side of the boathouse has a private bathroom with composting toilet, and has no heat or AC, however you don’t need to leave the boathouse to use it. There is a functional outdoor shower and sink under the main house. \n\nIf you can handle the above, this space is for you. It truly is glamping (glamourous camping) at its finest. Once in the boathouse it feels like a quiet retreat and as if you have the whole lake to yourself.  You are also more than welcome to use our canoe.\n\nPlease note, smoking is not allowed in the house or on the premises.\n\nYou can find us on Insta @thelittleblueboathouse \n\nDogs and thru-hikers:\n\n** A note about dogs: Unfortunately, at this time, we are not allowing dogs. Jack, our English Cream Golden Retriever, lives here and will want to play with your dog. All. Day. Long. It is also very easy for a dog to escape the backyard by swimming over to the neighbors house. The neighbors have four cats and we want to be sure to respect their privacy.\n\n***Thru-hikers: A discounted stay is available to those thru-hiking the Palmetto Trail.",
    "access": "The dock, the boathouse, the boat garage, the enclosed area under the main house, the backyard...",
    "neighborhood": "Lake Lanier is a private, 140 acre lake and is one of the best kept secrets of the Upstate. Nestled directly in between Asheville and Greenville, the boathouse is five minutes from beautiful Tryon, NC, 15 minutes to downtown Landrum, SC and 25 minutes to the Tryon International Equestrian Center.\n\nBring your bike and ride the 5-mile lake loop, or for the advanced rider, ride up Hogback Mountain or up the Saluda Grade and down the watershed and back. Down the road, is fantastic hiking at the Blue Wall Preserve/Palmetto Trail. You could also paddle our canoe around the peaceful 140-acre lake or simply relax and enjoy the stillness and quiet of true lakefront living.",

It is located a couple of streets from downtown and terrific restaurants. \nMy criticism is around the directions. You should get really clear directions to the houseboat.  There is no number on the unit and the units are not sequentially numbered.  The lock is also a bit tricky to get the key out of.",

There was an event and the parking was a hassle, we had to pay $25 for parking that my husband needed to move it by midnight.  Jodi the host didn’t offer to pay we had to asked her to do so.\nIs a different place nice but smaller than what the pictures look like.  They should put something that identify the place to easily find it.",

It was exactly what we expected based on the description. \nIt was a hot day when we came and I was a little worried if it would feel hot on the boat but the window ac unit was great at keeping the place cool and we felt extremely comfortable for sleeping (really comfy bed, with enough pillows for us too!) we also had a pretty big rainstorm the first night we were on the boat but felt totally great during the storm- it was actually very peaceful and a great atmosphere.

KJ was a great host, and the local small beer garden with woodfired pizza and live music was a huge bonus. Also, waking up and taking the (free) kayak out for a morning paddle was a great way to start the day. Began on the water, and finished the day soaking in the sunset with a cold beer on the rooftop of the boat. Definitely staying here again next time I’m in town!!",

We are in Verona, PA, a little river town about 10.7 miles upriver from Downtown Pittsburgh.  Enjoy a complementary kayak, paddle board or canoe rental to enjoy the river.

Enjoy the sunset on the top deck.",
    "space": "This boat may not be suitable for people who are tall. I’ve had a guest with a tall husband, he complained of low ceilings.\n\nIMPORTANT: This boat is down a flight of 12 plus stairs down to the dock. It is not a good fit if you have trouble going up and down stairs.  The dock rocks back and forth from the wake of other boats. If you have trouble with balance this would not be a good fit. There are no railings on the dock.  If you get sea sick this would not be a good fit. The boat does rock back n forth with wake when boats pass. Sometimes this can be little bit and sometimes this can be a lot. \n\nThe Nautaline named Oolikhanna  is situated on the Allegheny River. The name Allegheny comes from a local tribe called Lenape. The word, welhik hane or Oolikhanna,  which means \"best flowing river of the hills\" or \"beautiful stream\".  \n\nIt is not unusual to spy a blue heron, bald eagles or even a beaver or a turtle among other river inhabitants. We have enjoyed walking along sandy beaches of the Allegheny collecting treasures of the river both natural and man made.\n\nNote:  Please pack Lightly, like you are camping. Large luggage is not a good fit when carrying down the stairs and rolling it on the dock.  Please do not bring items of great value. Things do fall in the water!  If you bring a computer or a phone be extra cautious with them because accidents can happen. \n\nNoise & Marina Activity \nThis an active Marina. We have a Kayak, Sup and Canoe Rental business that runs thru out the week. There are other boats in the Marina that will be your neighbor. We have events Friday, Saturday and Sunday with live music, brewery/distilleries, and food trucks. Typically music ends by 9.  Check out the events @ 10.7 Marina. \n\nThere is a train across the river that is on the loud side. It varies on time that it comes by. \n\nWe have rowing teams that are often out on the river early in the am. They may be loud do to the mega phone that they use.\n\nPlease be ADVISED there are 17 stairs down to boat! And it is advised to pack lately it is a small boat with many stairs down to it.",

Oakmont is walking community.",

People nearby in the marina were very kind as well, which made the experience so much dreamier. Big bonus - the sailboat stayed perfectly cool the entire time. Definitely stay here if you're considering it! Bring people you're comfortable being in a snug space with.",

This boat was abandoned and then re-habbed into the perfect little floating hotel for up to 5. Docked in a gorgeous marina... Sit in the cock-pit and imagine you are sailing the seven seas on your next vacation. The vessel is equipped with a little extras too like electric and air conditioning. No bathroom on board, but marina bathrooms are only a short walk from your dockage!",
    "space": "This accommodation is a lot like camping on water. We have bath towels available at the marina upon request. Fitted sheets and blankets on board for sleeping.This sailboat comes with a little extras though like air conditioning and electricity. Please note that there is no head on board and all  bathroom/shower usage is provided by the marina facilities that are open 24/7 and maintained daily. The boat is not a pretty one  on the outside but is very comfortable and well kept on the inside.",
    "access": "There is plenty of parking on site and our location is walking distance to lots of Cocoa Beach attractions like Ron Jon Surf Shop, The Beach, Kayak/SUP Rental Places, Restaurants, and more!",

If you're looking for mints under your pillows please book the Hilton instead. \nOur boats are old but well maintained and comfortable for thier age. Weather can affect your stay, and this is a lot like camping.  \nWe provide linens  but feel free to bring your own for added comfort.  \n\nTHIS IS A CAMPING  STYLE STAY \nPLEASE ADVISE TO PREPARE FOR SUCH  WITH ITEMS LIKE BUG SPRAY, DISPOSABLE CUTLERY, COOLERS, CHAIRS, ETC.",
    "neighborhood": "The marina is always on island time... It is a great place to bring your family or escape for a girls weekend. Live music is always jamming on the weekends, and the bar and grill on site is the place to be. Mingle in with the locals on the docks and maybe even get a free boat ride!",
    "transit": "uber, lyft, e-scooter and e-bike rentals are also available all around town",
    "house_rules": "Pets should be registered with your reservation and kept leashed and cleaned up after while at the marina. This is a boat on the water so safety should be a top priority. \nIf you prefer to have a lock to secure the boat when you leave it (totally unnecessary for us, but a lot of people feel more comfortable that way), we no longer provide locks, please bring your own padlock type of combo or key lock, and please also take it with you when you leave!!",

    "summary": "Welcome to The Cove, Wilmington's most unique vacation rental community. \n\nFloating atop the Cape Fear River, our Riverwalk Villas offer an experience unlike any you've had before. \n\nFrom the gentle rocking of the river, to the peaceful view of the sunset, your stay at The Cove is sure to leave you feeling refreshed, restored, and wanting to return again soon.\n\n*Please note: Decor differs from current pictures, but is equally as beautiful. Updated pictures coming soon!",
    "space": "After parking in our free lot and making the 4 minute stroll down onto the docks of the Port City Marina, you’ll arrive at The Cove, Riverwalk Villas. Secured with dock ties and connected to electricity and water, you'll quickly realize that a stay at our dockside community offers the perfect mix of adventure, luxury and relaxation.\n\nUpon entering your villa, you’ll notice the spacious open concept kitchen/dining/living area and think to yourself, \"I should have brought more friends!\" (Don't worry, there's always next time.) \n\nCooking & Eating:\nWith a dining table that seats four, three benches along the island, and a kitchen stocked with everything you need to make a great meal, you could actually host your next Thanksgiving here. Complementary coffee, creamer and sugar are provided, alongside a drip coffee maker.\n\nLiving Room 1:\nIf cooking isn't your idea of fun, you may be more drawn to the beautifully decorated downstairs living space, where you can relax on the cozy couch surrounded by tall windows that overlook the Marina. \n\nBathroom 1:\nJust past the common area is the first floor bathroom, which features a walk-in shower and full size washer and dryer. Complementary shampoo, conditioner and body wash are provided in each of the bathrooms, as well as laundry pods, dryer sheets, hair dryer and a steamer. \n\nBedroom 1 (Queen):\nConnected by a pocket door is the downstairs bedroom with a Queen bed, large closet, ceiling fan, 40\" Smart TV, and access door to the quaint back patio; a great spot for some quiet reading or alone time.\n\nLiving Room 2 (Sofa bed):\nAs you make your way upstairs, you'll discover another large living space with a sectional couch (with pull out sleeper), 55\" Smart TV, desk and chair, and a beautiful view of the Cape Fear River through the sliding glass doors. \n\nUpstairs Patio:\nJust outside those doors, you'll find yourself on a large patio featuring an outdoor bar (sink & mini fridge), and a variety of comfortable furniture options. This patio is a fan favorite for everything from morning coffee, afternoon reading, evening spirits, or enjoying a meal. In the Summer months, you'll often hear live music coming from Marina Grill, our delicious on-site restaurant, or Live Oak Bank Pavilion Amphitheater, which is only a block away.\n\nBedroom 2 (King):\nBack inside and beyond the living room is the second floor bedroom, featuring a King bed, dresser, large closet, ceiling fan & 50\" Smart TV. \n\nBathroom 2:\nThe pocket door connects you from the bedroom to the second floor full bath.\n\nLocation:\n\nThe Cove is located in Port City Marina, which sits on the North end of the Riverwalk in Downtown Wilmington. Just a few steps from the Wilmington Convention Center and one block from both The Wilson Center, and Live Nation's Live Oak Bank Pavilion Amphitheater, a stay at The Cove offers the perfect solution for those wanting to avoid the chaos of parking, event traffic, and needing a DD.\n\nLess than a mile away you'll find the heart of Historic Downtown Wilmington. Whether you choose to stroll along the Riverwalk, take the free trolley, or drive a few blocks down Water Street, getting there is easy. With many local shops, restaurants, breweries, live music, and events, Downtown offers something for everyone to enjoy. Check out our Guidebook or \"Wilmington and Beaches\" online for recommendations and events.\n\nBeyond the borders of Downtown, a quick 8 minute drive or Uber ride will get you to the Wilmington International Airport (ILM), and within a 10 mile radius you'll find Wrightsville Beach, Jungle Rapids amusement/water park, UNCW (Go Seahawks!) and much more.\n\nIf you're interested in bringing your boat, our friends at Port City Marina would love to rent you a slip! Please reach out to them directly to coordinate that for the dates of your stay.\n\nIf this Villa is not available during your preferred time frame, please check out the listings for our other Riverwalk Villas at The Cove, and don't hesitate to reach out for assistance. We would love to have you Stay Afloat!",

Uniquely located on the Cape Fear River, PCM hosts everything from transient boaters to our permanent floating villas. \n\nThough currently scattered among the docks, we are watching with excitement as our custom built permanent dock is being constructed. This dock will host all 40 villas and will feature angled slips, beautiful landscaping, and a community space at the end of the dock.",

There were many positives: a comfortable bed, good wifi, a/c,  plenty of fluffy towels, adequate kitchen supplies, secure parking and a pleasant wrap around deck. However, it is old and in need of a few updates/maintenance with slanting floors, worn carpets and rugs and some general wear and tear. Overall, the positives outweighed the negatives and we enjoyed our stay in this little hidden cottage. boathouse.",

  "description": {
    "summary": "Welcome to your own private oasis on the Hillsborough River with breathtaking water and downtown Tampa views. Relax on your own private dock with a cocktail while you wave to passing boaters, kayakers and the occasional dolphin.",
    "space": "The house sits on a dock IN the Hillsborough River. You will instantly relax when you walk into the living room and are greeted with sweeping views of the river and downtown Tampa. The house was built over 50 years ago ( perfect if you are a lover of the charm of old houses) and is updated with modern amenities and decorated \"shabby chic\" in the old Florida style. You will spend most of your time sitting out on the dock, watching the passing boaters, wildlife and the beautiful view of downtown Tampa. There is nothing fancy about the boathouse, but it has what we all need -a comfy bed, fast WIFI and a comfortable and clean space to relax and get away from it all!",
    "access": "You have the entire house to yourself, the dock is for the exclusive use of boathouse guests.\n\nThe parking lot is shared with the other house that sits on the property, which is also a vacation rental. If you have a large group traveling with you, consider renting the house that sits on the shoreline- it's a two story duplex, called \" The Bungalow on the Hillsborough River\" and the \" Perch on the Hillsborough River\".",
    "notes": "There is a private, gated parking lot in front of the house that is shared with another house which is also a vacation rental.\n\nWe are taking the recommended steps as presented by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for cleaning, disinfecting and preparing our condo for your arrival. We are following the protocols laid out by the CDC and using the EPA-approved disinfectants for Hard (non-porous) Surfaces, Soft (Porous) Surfaces and Electronics. The linens, towels, bed sheets, etc. are washed per manufacturers guidelines.",
    "neighborhood": "The boathouse is located in Riverside Heights. This is one of the original neighborhoods that make up Tampa's urban core. The area is going through some new development, you will see many new apartment buildings going up in the area. It is an urban area, but once you walk out onto the dock, you feel like you are miles from everything but still right in the middle of it all.\n\nIf you ever decide to leave your chair on the dock, there is a TON to do in the area, But my favorite MUST Do is:\n\n\nWalk next door to Rick’s on the River and hop aboard the Pirate Water Taxi. This hop on/ hop off water taxi has over 18 stops up and down the river including stops at places like Curtis Hixon Park, the Tampa Museum of Art, the children’s museum, as well as numerous restaurants and bars.\n\nYou can also easily access all of Tampa's top attractions- Busch Gardens is a 15- 20 minute drive. Raymond James stadiumm/George Steinbrenner field  is a 5 min drive. The Tampa Riverwalk and Armature Works are a 5 minute drive. UT, downtown Tampa, Ybor City and South Tampa take 5-10 minutes to reach by car.",
    "transit": "You definitely need a car to get around. The neighborhood does have 1 restaurant next door, otherwise you'll be driving everywhere, but 5-15 minutes to get to all Tampa has to offer.\nUber or Lyft’s are plentiful in this area!",
    "interaction": "I am 10 minutes away, if you ever need anything I am here when you need me!",
    "house_rules": "No pets and no smoking inside. Do not swim off the dock.\n\nCheck out time is 11am, check in is 4pm. \nQuite time observed between 10pm and 7am.\n\nCleaning fee does not include trash removal or dish washing. Please complete these items upon check out. There is a $25 fee if not completed. \n\nProperty owner can not guarantee any services provided by 3rd party vendors such as cable, wifi, electric and water. If any issues arise during guest stay due to storms, area outages or any other vendor issue, property owner is not liable.\n* Please note our cancellation policy is not waived in the event of severe weather. It is highly recommended to purchase trip insurance when traveling to Florida during Hurricane Season*\n\nAs a guest, I agree to protect, indemnify, save and keep harmless, Evla Two Co and it's officers, owner of the property,2321 N Oregon Ave, Tampa, FL 33607, against and from any and all loss, cost, damage or expense, arising out of or from any accident or other occurrence on or about said premises causing injury to any person or property, including injury to ourselves, arising out of our use of the premise for the purpose of vacation rental, and comply with and perform all the requirements and provisions agreed to and specified on the rental period of my rental at the premises of 2321 N Oregon Ave. Tampa, FL 33607  \nI also agree not to allow entrance to the premises or use of the premises by anyone who has not been previously authorized entrance or use of the premises.  \n \nI also agree to pay for any and all damages to the premises caused by our use or negligence, excluding normal wear and tear. \nWe also agree to notify the owners of any damages or hazardous conditions immediately and to immediately discontinue use of the premises, until the condition can be corrected.",

The beds were comfortable, and when we had a torrential rain storm, it was glorious listening to it hit the roof while sleeping and feeling a gentle rocking from the wind. The area is very pretty and the upper deck is great. The interior is a home, with adorable signs everywhere. Michael and Rebecca were very nice. They also provide toiletries and coffee and certain kitchen necessities. The barbecue works but \nneeds to be thoroughly cleaned and a new grill, which I believe is in the works.",

Mount Dora had a lot of fun stuff to do, the food was amazing, and the little shops were nice. From this lake house you are in walking distance of downtown Mount Dora, so you don’t have to drive anywhere. Staying here is definitely worth the money, and Natalie was a great host. Better than staying in a hotel with paper thin walls and no privacy.",

We have no problems with using the marina and the few other boaters we met were very friendly.  The location was also convenient for both Savannah and Tybee Island.  \n\nIf we get back in the area, would definitely consider staying there again.",
