The dome is ideal for 1-2 people and the outside porch was perfect size (with the hot tub and fire table too).  I brought my laptop and Alexa speaker and both hooked up to internet wi-fi just fine.\nI'm going back!!!!",

    "summary": "Looking for a one-of-a-kind getaway? Well this is the one! \nCome glamp at our luxurious glamping dome that has all the amenities to make your trip one to remember. The huge bay window allows you to experience beautiful mountain sunrises and sunsets from the comfort of the couch. You can also relax in the outdoor hot tub, firepit, or ENO hammock to truly feel connected to the mountain view. Enjoy being only 20 minutes to downtown Asheville while feeling like you are in your own oasis.",
    "space": "On Insta? Come follow us at glamp_avl",
    "notes": "The dome is located at an elevation of ~2800 feet which gives great views of the surrounding Blue Ridge Mountains. The drive to the dome is all on paved roads except the last quarter mile which is gravel. The gravel stretch does have a hill that is moderately steep. Many smaller / lower riding vehicles such as Teslas and Elantras have made the drive with no issues - so you shouldn't have any problem. But given the choice a larger vehicle may be preferable to some. In the event of snow a 4x4 vehicle is required.",
    "neighborhood": "Our dome is at the highest point of a hill which gives a nice view of the surrounding mountains.",
    "transit": "The final 1/4 mile approach to the dome is a gravel road. The road has a few steep stretches, but these are easily navigated by maintaining speed.",
    "house_rules": "We allow dogs with a $100 fee, two dogs maximum. \n\nFor those that do not want to bring your own firewood, we have split & seasoned firewood available on site. The cost is $10 per night of your stay payable via vnmo at glamp_avl. \n\nHot tub is available for use year round, use at your own risk.",

I can’t stress enough how helpful she was and in light of that, I’d recommend the dome to anyone. \n\nWalking around the property feels like more of an adventure than a neighborhood. The whole area is forested and there are some cool structures and wildlife (we saw a few deer, lots of birds, and a ton of mushrooms during our stay). The dome is private enough to be secluded, but close enough to other properties on the land to feel safe. The dome itself is really comfortable, too. The shower is roomy, the bed is sturdy enough, and there is every thing you need to feel like you’re not camping (or even glamping). The view from the dome is great, even in the rainy weather, and it was nice to just relax indoors throughout our day. \n\nThe location was also great - a reasonable drive to multiple beaches and to nearby towns for dining options.",

    "summary": "Reconnect with nature at this unforgettable escape. Located about 25 minutes from beautiful Lake Michigan beaches. On the property, there are residential homes, eight acres of blueberries with free blueberry picking for all airbnb guests during blueberry season which is primarily from the middle of July to the middle of August. There is also a small natural foods retail store within walking distance. Relax, unwind, hike, play, and just enjoy being away from it all in this super private dome!",
    "space": "Beautiful open concept dome. Think Glamping. The hot tub is new and can keep up in all temps now! Open year round. You will love the peace and quiet of the location of this dome. We have an air conditioner for summer and a brand new wood burning stove (installed January 2023) and space heater for winter months. Full bathroom and comfy queen size bed. \nWe provide towels for the hot tub and for the shower. \nThere is a small fridge, a microwave, a 2-slice bread toaster, and a keruig coffee maker.",
    "access": "No Contact check-in and checkout.",
    "notes": "Just a bit of helpful information about the Dome in the winter and summer months. The dome has a mini-split that does have heat, although it only helps a little. In order to stay completely comfortable we have installed a new wood stove (1/23/23) that provides a lot of heat! It will keep the dome very warm when the temps drop below freezing and the mini split can’t keep up on its own. We provide firewood but just know that it’s a necessity to have that going if the temps are very cold. We also have a space heater, and a heated mattress pad. \n\nFor the summer months…We do have an air conditioning unit at the dome, but because of the dome not being insulated much it does get extremely warm inside the dome during the middle of the day.  If you have ever gone tent camping in the middle of the summer, you get that it’s hard to keep a tent type shelter cool when it’s so hot outside. With that being said, the evenings are amazing and the a/c has no problem when it’s not super hot out during the day. \n\nAnother thing to note about this Dome is that it’s wonderful for being “disconnected”, it’s private, has tons of open green space surrounded by trees, open sky and is beautiful and relaxing, but there is no wifi and although most have some cell service it’s definitely not awesome coverage, so please plan accordingly.",
    "transit": "We are located 20 minutes from South Haven, 15 minutes from Lake Michigan, and about 25 minutes from Saugatuck. In the local area there are a few orchards,  fruit patches, beaches, and amazing restaurants!",
    "interaction": "I am available almost anytime via messaging or texting. There is also someone that lives on the same property as this Dome that is happy to help with any issues that might come up during your stay. Just let us know",

The dome is perfectly appointed, with every amenity you could want. The natural surroundings of Vero Mountain are enough to keep one occupied for days, just wandering through the forest, which is alive with benevolent wildlife, and serene vortex energy. Wish I could live there! I will definitely be back!!",

It was so much fun getting to play with the baby animals down by the farm, grilling, chilling in the hot tub and bath tub, the bed was super comfy, and of course the view was amazing. There were so many little details that really made the experience like fluffy bath robes and bath salts. The weather was comfortable and we even got a hint of rain in the morning before we left, which was SO peaceful. At one point we unknowingly disturbed some bees living under the dome and I got stung, but Chris came up quickly to take care of the problem and even brought Benadryl with her. While this was a definite splurge and I wish I could afford it a bit more often, pricing is relatively fair for what you’re getting. Overall it was a fantastic experience, and my boyfriend has already decided that we’ll be returning eventually!",

To begin, it is by far one of the cleanest places I have stayed in. Every inch of the dome was spotless. It was so quiet and peaceful. A true break from the hustle and bustle of city life. There was bottled/sparking water, fresh eggs, coffee, and tea for our enjoying pleasure. There was also fuzzy robes, house shoes, and towels for the hot tub. The amenities in this place were endless. I appreciated the attention to detail in the dome. I felt like I was at an expensive resort. 10/10 would recommend! Do not hesitate to book this getaway.",

It was perfect temperature at night. All in all we had a blast and will definitely come back — we loved the company of the little kitty that was by the barn :-) super sweet.",

    "space": "Come visit this unique camping dome in the Smoky Mountains! See the night sky from your bed and enjoy being close to nature. This is a Glamping experience. Glamping is luxurious camping with more modern amenities like power, finished floors, beautiful views, and comfortable furnishings, but it is still camping. The domes are not insulated so it can get hot during the day in the summer and cold at night in the winter. There is an A/C and a heater in the unit, as well as a heated blanket, but similar to camping, expect the weather to be a factor.  Explore Tennessee by day and relax in your dome at night. The dome has a large bay window and several sky windows. You’ll find a barn with an apartment, a tiny house, and three other domes on the property. Inside the barn, we have indoor showers and bathrooms. There is also a mini fridge, microwave, and coffee maker available for all guests to use. Additionally, we have an outdoor shower, but it will be shut off during winter months. There is also a propane fireplace to enjoy s'mores or hotdogs at night and a picnic table to eat and prepare meals. \n\nPET POLICY: We are pet friendly and understand pets are part of the family. We gladly welcome our guests traveling with pets. There will be a $20 fee per stay for each pet. Pet's MAY NOT be left unattended in the dome or on the property. Guests are liable for any damages done by their animal during their stay.",

If you are unable to access Wi-Fi at your dome, try the guest area in the passway of the barn to access a stronger WiFi signal. \n\nThere is no plumbing inside the domes. Bathrooms and showers are provided onsite and are shared with other guests.",
    "neighborhood": "Nestled in the Great Smoky Mountains, you’ll be in a quiet area where you can get away from it all. You’ll be 15 minutes from the Great Smoky Mountains National Park Cosby entrance and just 30 minutes to Dollywood. It’s also a beautiful 25-30 minute scenic drive from Historic Gatlinburg, Pigeon Forge, Sevierville, and Newport. The property is across the street from a beautiful creek and you’ll have a mountain top in your back yard.",
    "transit": "Pull in front of the barn and park on the gravel, about 10 yards from your dome.",
    "interaction": "The dome is equipped with a keypad for self check-in. We’re also very accessible via the Airbnb app, call or text.",
    "house_rules": "Guests must pay for any damage. No smoking in or near the dome please. Please be safe around heat and fire sources and be respectful of any other guests.",

Come to this off grid sweet escape and relax in nature’s paradise. Enjoy complete privacy, 20 minutes to Asheville, ski slopes, Blue Ridge Parkway. 1/2 mile to hiking, coffeehouse, restaurants, University.",
    "space": "Property is up a gravel mountain drive. Area around the dome is cleared but much of the 11 acres is wooded. 1/2 mile mountain drive does drop off in places so please use caution ⚠️. Dome is open but has a wall separating the sleep/lounge area from the kitchenette. Kitchenette includes microwave, mini fridge, mini freezer, butcher top countertop, hot/cold drinking water dispenser, kitchen supplies, dishes, and pour over coffee. Important to note is that we have upgraded to a larger wood stove to keep you warm in the coldest winter days and nights!",
    "access": "Guests will have access to the 1/2 mile driveway and all of the area around the dome. Total of 11 acres",
    "notes": "Dome is completely off grid, runs completely off solar power. Guests can check how much power they have on the generator under the kitchen countertop by hitting the display button. Electric should be sufficient but glampers will do are responsible for using the electricity responsibly so as to not drain the battery completely. \n\nThere is a microwave for cooking, a charcoal grill on the deck (charcoal and grill necessities included) and a fire ring for open flame cooking. There is a hammock provided for warmer days!\n\nPlease note that when temperatures dip into the teens and the single digits make sure to bring warm clothing as dome can still get a bit chilly on those nights. Also note that there is a hand washing station outside of the dome next to the port a potty however when temperatures dip into the teens and single digits the water can freeze up in the hand washing station. We do also provide hand sanitizer as a back up. In addition, the only form of heat is a wood burning stove with starters and wood provided, so it will be your responsibility to make sure that the stove keeps burning with wood as to keep the dome warm. This most likely will entail getting up at least once a night to stoke/put wood on the fire. On very hot summer days the dome can get very warm inside. We have a high powered fan and black out curtains to help but it still can get very warm. Best to utilize the outdoor space in the late morning/early afternoon hours or use this time to explore the area. There is no air conditioning. This is a Glamping experience which is between camping and a typical Airbnb experience so please plan/pack accordingly. Thanks!",
    "neighborhood": "Dome is completely private at the top of the mountain. 1/2 mile down the mountain driveway is a nice quiet neighborhood just 1/2 mile down the road from country cattle fields and the infamous Bailey Mountain hiking trails!",
    "transit": "Parking is available at the top of the mountain either above or below the dome. 4WD is not necessary for getting up the mountain,  however is necessary to park above or directly next to the dome.",
    "interaction": "My husband Jeremy and I are available to answer any questions and help with anything while you are staying at our Mountain getaway. You can reach us by messaging us through Airbnb.",

Fantastic modern Glamping (feels like a 5 star hotel inside) with a host that goes over and above to make sure your experience is special. 15min away from Gravenhurst makes this dome well located. It is close to a well travelled road so you will hear cars once in a while drive past but it is in a very pretty wooded area with lots of amenities (fire pit, BBQ, games and outdoor hangout areas). There is no wifi and very little cell reception but there is a well stocked library of blue ray dvds or make sure to download some stuff before hand. Great opportunity to bring a book to catch up on. Highly recommended!",

We decided to do the Celebration Package. When we arrived there was a beautiful cake, balloons on the bed and many other goodies. The dome is very spacious. The kitchen area has everything you will need to make any meal. There was an amazing movie collection to pick from. The bathroom was extraordinary, with heated floor, amazing shower and towel warmer. The bed was huge and super comfy. It was so nice to sleep underneath the stars. Outside there was a barbecue, propane fire pit, games, hammocks and many seating areas. The dome was super relaxing and in a great town. We did some hiking as well visited downtown. I would highly recommend the muskoka dome, honestly I wish I lived there!",

Every inch of the property was beautiful, peaceful, inviting, and comfortable. The hosts were super friendly and welcoming but also not invasive. The morning sun woke us up early, but we loved watching the sunrise (and the excuse to take naps later in the day!). There were plenty of food options just a few miles away, but next time we’ll bring food and utilize the kitchen and grill! There were several activity options nearby (we chose kayaking and a distillery tour) but next time we’ll spend more time enjoying the gorgeous property. Hands down the best “camping” adventure we’ve ever had. There was more to experience than we could manage in our short weekend trip. We will definitely be back!",

    "summary": "Nature meets luxury in this unique Glamping Experience. If you don’t see your dates available, pls check out our other dome “The Overlook.”\n\nEnjoy the privacy of a peaceful, secluded setting, without sacrificing comfort. Relax in the hot tub or by the pond. Roast smores at the firepit at night, ( wood not provided) sleep under the stars on a king-size comfort foam bed. Connect with your surroundings without having to rough it.",
    "space": "Do you really have A/C in there? Yep. And Plumbing? Definitely! Wi-Fi? Nespresso? Yessir! \n\nHere's what's on the inside of the 700 sq/ft space. Mini-split A/C system, gas fireplace/heater, Kitchenette w/ cooking and serving accessories (induction cooktop), complementary coffee, espresso, and tea, glassware and plates, 4.5 c/f fridge, microwave, tankless water heater, enclosed toilet room, shower, linens, blankets, toiletries, leather loveseat. \n\nOutdoors = pergola w/hot tub and bar seating, patio furniture, propane grill, pond w/ Adirondack chairs, and a bold stream (1-3 feet deep). We have a fire pit, but do not keep dry wood stocked so plan to bring some if you’re planning to use the fire pit. \n\nNote: our vision for the place is a \"couples retreat\", we love kiddos and pets, but we didn't design the dome to accommodate them.",
    "access": "We send the access code to guests on the day of arrival. \n\nThere are two domes on the property, this one is the larger of the 2. Guests will have use of approx 1 acre each, we have designed the space with privacy in mind. Each dome has its own private parking area, hot tub, and fire pit. Other than the driveway, you will not share anything with another guest.",
    "neighborhood": "Our property is located at the end of a private drive, Just 5 miles from Chimney Rock State Park. Lake Lure is right around the corner, and the shops and restaurants of Hendersonville are about 20 minutes away. You can be in downtown Asheville in about 40 minutes (~24miles).\n\nThere are a few small convenient stores close by, but the nearest large grocery store is about 20 minutes away, so pls plan accordingly. We recommend stopping by the Ingles before you arrive. There are 2 locations... off the Hwy 64 exit if you are coming from interstate 26. Or ~2 miles off the Hwy 74 exit if you are coming from interstate 40. GPS will get you to both.",
    "transit": "Heads up folks... you'll be on a gravel road when you get here! Edney Inn Rd winds you through a picturesque setting of farms and vacation homes. When the pavement ends at the artist's studio, you've still got one mile to go through the woods. There are no steep roads or edge of the mountain drama, we are quite accessible for any type of vehicle. Just know you'll be off the beaten path a ways.",
    "interaction": "We live locally and can be on-site for emergencies. Otherwise available by phone for questions.",
    "house_rules": "- Please use the flip flops or slippers provided inside the dome, or bring your own. No shoes inside.\n\n- The property is surrounded by hundreds of acres of undeveloped mountain land. Animals live here too, and we don't want to attract them with food or garbage. Therefore, we require that NO FOOD OR GARBAGE is left outside overnight or at any point that you are not eating. \n\n- We don't have a TV in the dome, and no cable internet is available in the area, so our Wi-Fi is a hotspot. It works great, but has limited monthly high speed data. Please use for emails, communication, etc., not for streaming video or heavy data apps.\n\nThanks!",

The site is somewhat close to a country road but again, not an issue in my opinion. The dome gets a bit warm during the day (to be expected, just like any regular camping tent would) but cools off quickly once the sun starts to set. Overall, great stay and would certainly visit again.",

Peaceful and many areas to rest and chill, either by the water in rocks or hammocks, rocking chairs or hammocks in the deck overlooking the creek or by the fire. Almost like camping with a few pluses, and no worries if it rains or downtime setting up and down tents!\n\nThe kids (3 and 7) really enjoy the creek, swimming or lounging in sandy spots, or climbing the small water fall by the bridge. Lots of nearby attraction and hikes.",

In the FAQ/document about the check in and amenities there were just small things that were off. There does seem to be some kind of leak or water damage happening in the first dome. There were no paper towels. I brought some anyway. There were also three or four air fresheners that were very strong with synthetic held perfume/chemical smell. This triggered a really bad migraine and then later an asthma attack with my partner. We really would’ve preferred to know ahead of time and had them taken out. We did remove them for our stay and put them back on the shelves when we left, the linens were great. The pillows were awesome. The fire pit is great. There is a broken chair beside the fire pit that was broken from when we arrived. So we moved furniture from the deck to the fire pit.",

The property was amazing with the creek and waterfalls. It just needs to be kept up if it is being rented out. It looks like at one time it was a priority but not any more. 😞",

    "summary": "Primitive glamping-camping in Boone NC is Tree House HOT! Gram-worthy, nature-immersive, eco-friendly experience: @glampingunplugged\n\nHuge bay window, 2 built-in cargo net hammocks (one OVER the creek!), king bed + bunks, fire pit, lighting, 8+ acres (shared w/ 2 domes) & trout stream.\n\nNo WiFi. No plumbing. No electricity. NO PROBLEM! We thought of everything! Next level primitive camping experience.\n\n365 Year-Round Camping:  Winter Igloo, anyone? Unplug to Recharge!\n\nPet Fee $25.",
    "space": "Glamping Unplugged is primitive camping at an unprecedented level. And we did not spend a mint on this steel dome to disappoint! We have created a space for your much-needed digital detox on a beautiful tract of land that allows for privacy, unlike any other campground.  Immerse yourself in nature and unplug ... step a few inches outside of your comfort zone and you will thank us later. \n\nCan we camp in the winter? Yes, a tent stove is provided plus we have insulated the floor and the tent walls! Light a fire and expect a cozy stay!\n\nArrive to a king bed + bunks with cozy clean sheets over a noisy state-stocked trout stream.  A high-end cooler is your fridge. A state park steel grill is your kitchen.  USB powered lighting and power chargers are provided in addition to linens, pillows, towels and toilet paper.  There are screens for the windows. We provide moist biodegradable towelettes for deodorizing and cleaning your body (or take a dip in the stream!) and, of course, there is a private port-o-toilet.\n\n“Everything works better when you unplug it for a little while ... including yourself.”\n\nHelp us craft the best experience for future guests, share photos with us for social media: @glampingunplugged & we will maybe refund accordingly,  'grandfather you in,\" discount a future stay and/or become part of the Unplugged family!\n\nWe provide a multi-page F.A.Q. immediately after you book that delves deep into the experience to make sure we are exactly what you are looking for!\n\nWe are pet friendly with a $25 pet fee (breed restrictions & pre-approval required).",
    "access": "We require that you park just off a state-maintained road and hike 100 yards down a relatively level path and then up steps to your Dome.  You will then have your private deck with chimney, rockers & grill, as well as, 8.5 acres, 1200+ feet of creek frontage for your family to unplug, recharge and enjoy, shared by only 2 other Domes!\n\nGo explore!  Go Unplug!",
    "notes": "Once you reserve, you will reserve a multi-multi page FAQ sheet to confirm that this experience is right for you!",
    "neighborhood": "We chose the land because it is on a popular, state-stocked trout stream.  Outfitters have been sneaking onto your land and using it as their go-to fishing hole with clients for years!  We look forward to your exploring the land and making mountain camping memories. \n\nThis land is meant to be shared: 1200+ feet of creek frontage, the HUGE 3-story wall of rocks across the creek from the Dome, the cave, the swimming and fishing holes and the waterfalls.  We have created a spot you can stay at for days, perfect for the \"unplugged\" experience. Keep an open mind and simply go with the unplugged, eco-friendly experience!\n\nDeep Gap is located next to Boone NC, the center of the High Country.  Location, location, location! Only 8 miles from the Blue Ridge Parkway, our closest major waterfall is Cascades Trail, just off the Parkway in Purlear. 10 mins to Food Lion, 15 minutes into Boone.",
    "transit": "You will need a car to get to the property, but while on property, you will be on foot!  We do NOT permit cars over the bridge.  Parking is about 100 yards from your front step, its an easy walk and is an intricate part of the build up of anticipation! Pack accordingly! Bring Your Own Water. A cart is supplied for you to bring what gear you have up to your glampsite!",
    "interaction": "CONTACTLESS ENTRY! We are remote, we are purposefully unplugged, please do not expect a cell signal.\n\nWe are available via airbnb app and cell phone when you have service - please read our FAQ in full before arriving to plan accordingly!  \n\nGlamping Unplugged's cleaner/caretaker lives in Boone (15 minutes) if you need something important, otherwise, you are camping, go with the flow!",

Location is about 10 min from Chimney Rock and 30-40 min from Asheville. \n\nI thought I would enjoy relaxing by the river or the pond, but naive me forgot that it was the dead of summer and there are tons of flies and mosquitos that will chase you this deep in the mountains so I spent most of the time inside the some when I was there. I think the owners recognize this as an issue and made sure to include a good amount of citronella candles around the property to help. The bugs don't take away from the beauty of the place, but I think I personally would've enjoyed the place more during winter when bugs are not there and when winter has enough of a cold bite to make you not want to leave the hot tub.\n\nThe dome was clean and was nicely well stocked with amenities if you forgot to bring a toothbrush, toothpaste, tampon, hairdryer and etc.\n\nHosts were easy and quick to communicate with and brought tiki fuel the next day when our torches ran out of fuel.",

Heating and A/C, full bathroom, memory foam mattress & luxury bedding. Functional kitchenette, propane grill and private outdoor living space with private hot tub and fire pit. (Wood not provided.)",
    "space": "Here's what's on the inside of the 450 sq/ft space. Mini-split A/C system, Kitchenette w/cooking and serving accessories (induction cooktop & toaster oven), complementary coffee (Keurig and pour over carafe) tea, glassware and plates, 4.5 c/f fridge, microwave, shower, linens, blankets, toiletries. Outdoor fire pit w/hot tub and  patio furniture, propane grill, pond and a bold stream (1-3 feet deep). We do not keep dry wood stocked so please bring wood if you plan to use the fire pit. \n\nNote: our vision for the property is a \"couples retreat\", we love kiddos and pets but we did not design the space to host them. We are firm with this policy, thanks for understanding.",
    "access": "We send a code to each guest on the day of arrival, along with other details about the Dome. Guests may check in anytime after 4pm.",
    "notes": "We love kiddos and pets, but our structures and property features are not designed to accommodate them... we are firm about NO children and NO Pets. Thanks for understanding.\n\nGuests should have no problem getting cell phone coverage with most providers. Unfortunately however, cable WiFi is not available in our area, so our unit is a mobile hotspot that DOES NOT have unlimited data. Therefore we ask guests to use for communications, not streaming.",
    "neighborhood": "Our property is located at the end of a private drive, Just 5 miles from Chimney Rock State Park. Lake Lure is right around the corner, and the shops and restaurants of Hendersonville are about 20 minutes away. You can be in downtown Asheville in about 35 minutes (~24miles).\n\nThere are a few small convenient stores close by, but the nearest large grocery store is about 20 minutes away, so pls plan accordingly. We recommend stopping by the Ingles before you arrive. There are 2 locations... off the Hwy 64 exit if you are coming from interstate 26. Or ~2 miles off the Hwy 74 exit if you are coming from interstate 40. GPS will get you to both.",
    "transit": "Heads up folks... you'll be on a gravel road when you get here! Edney Inn Rd winds you through a picturesque setting of farms and vacation homes. When the pavement ends at the artist's studio, you've still got one mile to go through the woods. There are no steep roads or edge of the mountain drama, we are quite accessible for any type of vehicle. Just know you'll be off the beaten path a ways.",

It would be important to know you can’t park close to the dome, it’s a bit of a walk but they provide a big wagon for your things. The property is stunning. Worth the money!",

It was so perfectly decorated and completely stocked with everything you need for a wonderful getaway. Angela has put a lot of heart and thought into the place to make it the best experience ever. She had great communication and clear instructions. There’s so much fit into the space and yet it still felt spacious and so comfortable. The bed, pillows, and blankets were all very comfortable. The furniture outside was so peaceful and inviting. I’d give it 10 stars if I could. We didn’t want to leave. And we can’t wait to come back.",

    "summary": "As featured on A&E’s Living Smaller (Episode 8), the Tiny Geopod offers a unique and upscale experience for the nature loving adventurer. Have it both ways with a retreat in nature & a 5 minute walk to historic Todd or 20 min drive to Boone & W.Jefferson. Enjoy the Tiny Pod and outdoor spaces with hot tub, fire table, gazebo and comfy outdoor furniture. Cook in the Pod's outdoor kitchen (NOTE: kitchen modified during winter) or grill. Relax & refresh while experiencing the joy of tiny living!",
    "space": "The Tiny Geopod was designed and built with the vision for simple yet comfortable living that supports a deep connection with nature and a smaller footprint on the planet. The meticulously designed 130 square foot Tiny Geopod makes use of every inch and lacks for nothing.\n\nWith the small interior footprint, the majority of the space is dedicated to three truly magical outdoor areas. The outdoor main deck is equipped with a breakfast bar area, gas fire pit, and seating area to relax and enjoy nature in. The second outdoor space brings you even further among the trees, accentuating the winter views of the mountains. Read a good book, take a nap, or enjoy the view of the trees while relaxing on the outdoor patio furniture or relax in the hot tub after a nice day of hiking. The third space is a unique outdoor kitchen (Note: this space is partially functional during winter - see details below) and bathroom space. Cook delicious meals on the cute small gas stove top or grill to your heart's content on the stainless 3 burner gas grill. You can expect to see birds, deer, and other wildlife about while you enjoy the outdoors.\n\nThe Tiny Geopod itself was built with all the essentials and packaged into a cozy, comfortable, and retreat-like space. With an emphasis on sustainability, the Geopod is powered from the nearby community solar garden and guests can reduce waste by recycling and composting on the property. A well equipped kitchen (Note: details on modified partially functional kitchen during winter/late spring below),  unique high end bathroom, convertible working/dining area, and a comfy sleeping space with cozy sheets are a few of the features. Use the high speed wifi to watch a movie on your laptop or tablet while relaxing after a day of exploring. A coffee and tea bar, along with  shampoos/soaps are just a few of the other amenities provided.\n\nNote on modified kitchen (during winter/ early spring when freezing temps occur):  The kitchen faucet will be shut off during this time but water can be obtained from the sink in the fully functional heated bathroom. During this time, disposable plates/cutlery will be provided and the grill, with provided grilling tools, can be used for cooking. A French coffee press, water kettle, and coffee/creamer/sugar will also be provided. You YOU WILL NOT HAVE ACCESS TO POTS OR PANS for the stove since there isn't a good way to wash them.",
    "access": "Guests will have PRIVATE access to the whole Tiny Geopod, the kitchen/bathhouse, and the patio area with hot tub, gazebo, and 2 fire tables",
    "notes": "LOCATION: The Geopod is located on an approximately 3 acre plot of land with 2 other tiny house rentals that can be booked separately or, depending on availability, can be rented together. We emphasize privacy and have set up each home to maximize guest seclusion and minimize visibility of the properties from each other. Also to note, the Geopod is located in close proximity to NC 194, a lightly traveled paved road with occasional traffic. Guests should be aware that they will hear the occasional car pass by.\n\nACCESSIBILITY: To reach the Tiny Geopod, you must climb up the steps from the parking spot and follow the approximately 150 foot pathway to your tiny destination. \n\nHEATING/COOLING: The Tiny Geopod is equipped with central ducted heating and cooling as well as dedicated small additional heaters. However, please be aware that the Pod is not insulated like regular houses and will not heat and cool as well. Please be prepared with warm clothing in the winter!\n\nKITCHEN: Unfortunately, the kitchen sink will be closed during winter/early months to avoid freezing pipes. but water can be obtained from the sink in the fully functional heated bathroom. During this time, disposable plates/cutlery will be provided and the grill, with provided grilling tools, can be used for cooking. A French coffee press, water kettle, and coffee/creamer/sugar will also be provided. You YOU WILL NOT HAVE ACCESS TO POTS OR PANS for the stove since there isn't a good way to wash them.\n\nPARKING: You will have one dedicated parking space for your use during your stay. If you have another vehicle or are towing a trailer, you can park it across the street in a large pullout.",
    "neighborhood": "Whatever you’re in the mood for, you will find it nearby. Historic downtown Todd is only a 10-minute drive, where you will find live music in the summer, the famous Todd Mercantile, and locals and tourists hanging out. RiverGirl Fishing Company and the New River are also located in downtown Todd and offer fishing, biking, kayaking, and tubing. Just a 17-minute drive from the cabin is Elk Knob State Park with miles of hiking, biking, jogging, exploring, and a stunning view at the top. Appalachian Ski Mtn, the Blue Ridge Parkway, ziplining, golfing, hunting, and countless hiking trails are within 30 minutes of the property. Grandfather Mountain, many more hiking trails and countless wineries are within an hour's drive. It really is the best of both worlds with city life and nature readily accessible.",
    "transit": "You can walk to downtown Todd in 5 minutes or less or drive to Boone or West Jefferson in approximately 20 minutes. The Geopod is located off of NC 194 South, a lightly traveled road with occasional traffic. NC 194 South is a famous biking road and it takes approximately 1 hour to bike to Boone or Jefferson.",
    "interaction": "Guests will have the whole place to themselves but can reach out with any questions via AirBnb messaging",
    "house_rules": "Quiet hours after 9pm. Please remove shoes at door.\n\nDO NOT PLACE HOT POTS/PANS directly on wood countertops or tables (this will cause burn damage!!).\n\nABSOLUTELY NO SMOKING inside or near the Geopod. You will be charged a $500 smoke removal fee if any smoke smell is detected.\n\nABSOLUTELY NO PETS! Our insurance policy does not cover pets so we unfortunately have to be strict with our no pet rule. A $100 pet fee will be charged if any pet hairs or other evidence are found inside the property, in addition to any damage fees.",

We enjoyed the record player, grill, fire pit, and hot tub.   The cooking area was all outside because of the dome nature.  They had a hotplate we used with the grill and were easy to use.   Would be nice to have a toaster inside with the microwave for more options. Dome even held up well in a thunderstorm our second night. Would recommend and hope to stay again sometime.",

The inside of the place was very clean and had a good vibe to it. Be aware there are many little bugs outside of the dome since we’re in nature but none of them were really something to worry about. Everything works just fine, the grill, microwave, mini refrigerator. Also one thing that surprised us was how cool the inside of the dome was, since we went during summer we assumed that it would be hot be it really wasn’t, on the first night we were quite of cold during our sleep witch was nice hahah. But anyways I very well recommended! Justice is a very nice host and waited for us outside on our check-in witch was very welcoming.",

    "summary": "Experience a taste of Japandi in this glamping dome experience. Enjoy this unique space on our private property that feels like a piece of countryside near the city, and experience the mind and body benefits of being closer to nature with the comforts of indoor amenities. Complete with heating and A/C, full zen-inspired bathroom, memory foam mattress & luxury European duvet. Enjoy your meal around a Japanese inspired floor table with straw mats and meditation cushion for seating.",
    "space": "This 415 sq/ft space includes: Mini-split A/C system, Kitchenette with basic preparation accessories (cutting board, knives, utensils), complementary coffee (Nespresso and pour over carafe), tea kettle and tea bar, glassware and a set of homemade pottery bowls, plates, and mugs, 3.1 c/f fridge and freezer, microwave, shower, shower essentials, towels, blankets. Private outdoor lounging area with natural stone firepit and adirondack chairs overlooking a meadow. Plan to bring wood if you desire to use the fire pit; you are also welcome to collect any available wood on our property.\n\nSay hi to our friendly roaming chickens!",
    "access": "We send a code to each guest on the day of arrival, and will send additional check-in details about the Dome. Guests may check in anytime after 4pm. We will have a private driveway dedicated to your parking.",
    "notes": "Our space is geared primarily as a couples retreat and for solo travelers. We love kiddos and pets, but our property features were not designed to accommodate them, so we cannot allow either children or pets for overnight stays at this time. Thank you for understanding this. \n\nGuests should have no problem getting cell phone coverage with providers within the dome due to full wifi coverage, but signal may be spotty outside of this space (AT&T seems to have the best coverage overall in this area regardless of wifi connection).\n\nThe Surrounding Area\nWe are nestled in a beautiful area close to Hillsborough, Durham, and Chapel Hill. Located 15 minutes from Downtown Hillsborough and the lively 9th St of Durham, and 17 minutes to downtown Durham, there is not a shortage of options in the area. If looking for beautiful trails, go no further than the Eno River and Brumley Nature Preserve 7 minutes away. \n\nInspiration behind the Design\nJapandi, known for its natural fusion of Japanese and Scandinavian design, includes the use of organic materials, natural light, and a beautiful but functional interior to create a calming and cozy space. The Japanese element is influenced by “wabi-sabi”, a concept of embracing imperfection and impermanence. The Scandinavian element incorporates “hygge” (pronounced hyoo guh), which brings in the element of coziness, well-being, and contentment with loved ones.\n\nWe hope for our dome to be a rejuvenating space for couples and individuals, to awaken the spirit and to help one reconnect with the natural world and one another.",
    "neighborhood": "Set in a rural neighborhood with a countryside feel.",
    "interaction": "We live onsite within the main house, and will be accessible most times to offer support as needed during your stay. Messages to us work best, and we'll try to respond as soon as possible!",
    "house_rules": "No parties please, we live in a rural neighborhood and especially as this is a dome, sound really does travel. Please respect our neighbors.\nPlease do not bring children (ages 0-12). As much as we love them, the space was not created to accommodate them.",

The open shower is great and clean. It has almost everything that you would need, basic utensils etc. The only problem was we didn’t take any rain coats or umbrella. It would be great if it was onsite! But also, our bad that we didn’t really check the weather beforehand. Overall great experience! Jordan was very responsive and friendly! Definitely recommend!",

    "space": "The Tiny Treepod was designed and built with the vision for simple yet comfortable living that supports a deep connection with nature and a smaller footprint on the planet. The meticulously designed 315 square foot Tiny Treepod and 100 square foot bathhouse (just steps away from the Treepod) makes use of every inch and lacks for nothing.\n\nThe Treepod offers a unique nature immersion experience in the tree surrounded nook in the side of the hill with winter view of the nearby mountains. The deck is equipped with a hot tub, gas fire pit, gas grill, and seating areas to relax and enjoy nature in. Below the deck, you'll have access to hanging chairs and a second gas fire pit. Read a good book, take a nap, or enjoy the view of the trees while relaxing on the outdoor patio furniture or relax in the hot tub after a nice day of hiking. You can expect to see birds, deer, and other small wildlife about while you enjoy the outdoors.\n\nThe Tiny Treepod itself was built with all the essentials and packaged into a cozy, comfortable, and retreat-like space. With an emphasis on sustainability, the Treepod is powered from the nearby community solar garden and guests can reduce waste by recycling on the property. A well equipped kitchen,  unique high end bathroom (just steps away from the Treepod), working/dining area, and a comfy sleeping space with cozy sheets are a few of the features. Use the high speed wifi to watch a movie on your laptop or tablet while relaxing after a day of exploring. A coffee and tea bar, along with high end shampoos/soaps are just a few of the other amenities provided.",

We emphasize privacy and have set up each home to maximize guest seclusion and minimize visibility of the properties from each other. Also to note, the Treepod is located on a hill above a very small neighborhood and will be able to see couple of homes below in the distance. \n\nACCESSIBILITY: To reach the Tiny Treepod, you must climb up the steps from the parking spot and follow the approximately 100 foot pathway to your tiny destination. \n\nHEATING/COOLING: The Tiny Treepod is equipped with a minisplit for heating and cooling as well as dedicated small additional heaters.

Lots of bugs which is to be expected but the amount of spiders that I saw while trying to drift off to sleep wasn’t an amount I was comfortable with. The windows weren’t clean so they were hard to see through which was disappointing as I booked it because of the unique experience of being in a “bubble.” The bathroom on top of that seemed to not be maintained, with the shower curtain molding and even some parts of the shower not being cleaned properly. Walls of the bathroom seemed to be water damaged or something else I’m not sure. Some of the lighting equipment that I’m assuming is for the dark walk to the bathroom did not work or barely lit up. The outside was beautiful, stocked of utensils that could be used to grill. Lots of chairs and areas to explore. Just expected a little more especially with the pictures showing cleaner bathroom and dome conditions. Disappointed. And for the price at that?No thank you.",

It was so beautiful, peaceful, and relaxing (as it can be with a toddler🤣)  \nWil was incredibly awesome to communicate with, super helpful (even when we accidentally locked the bathroom door at night and had to have someone come unlock it🫢whoops!) \nThe dome is beautifully decorated and super clean with all the amenities you would need to glamp in comfort. \n12 out of 10 rating! We will be back for a longer period next time as we plan on making this one of our spots! ❤️\n\n* I will note for those looking for extreme quiet, it is close to a road so you do hear cars, but it’s not terrible and it is so worth the visit!",

    "summary": "Fall asleep under the stars in this picturesque geodesic dome by the Hiawassee River. It has space heaters, a portable AC unit, heated blanket and wood burning stove. No central heat/air. \n\nThe Dome is in a private campground with 3 other campers beside our family's 8-acre property.\n\nTiny Dome has fresh linens, towels, queen bed, mini fridge, microwave, kitchen cart, & mountain well water.\n\nBath house, shower, sink, & laundry is 100 ft. away. Enjoy safe Glamping in style!",
    "space": "***Please read FULL description below before booking this Airbnb :)\n\nThe Tiny Dome is in a private campground on our family property along with 3 other campers including an Airstream which is also available on Airbnb. \n\nStaying in a Geodesic Dome is a full sensory experience: Watch the flow of clear mountain water or the bright stars from your queen bed. Listen to the crackling fire when it’s cold outside, or sit outside by your fire pit and hear true white noise as the rushing river runs right beside you!  Smell the fresh mountain air with a subtle scent of a campfire and  plethora of floral scents from the garden just across the river!  Taste the smoked mountain rainbow trout you’ve caught and cooked in our Big Green Egg. And finally, feel yourself exhale, relaxing into your true nature.\n\nWhat is Glamping?\n\"Glamping (Glamourous Camping) is where stunning nature meets modern luxury. It's a way to experience the untamed and completely unique parts of the world—without having to sacrifice creature comforts\". \n\nThings to note before booking:\n - Glamping is not for everyone! \n-  Unlike a hotel room, you will be immersed in the elements.\n- You will see bugs both inside and out.\n- The dome is not completely temperature controlled. We do have a portable AC unit, wood stove, and space heater but it is a tent without insulation so you will likely get hot and/or cold during your stay.\n- AT&T gets good service, but many other providers don't get service. We do have Wifi.\n- We are next to Unicoi Turnpike (Highway) so there will be highway noise.\n- No pets allowed.\n- There is not running water inside the dome. There is a shared Bathhouse with a toilet, shower, sink, and laundry about 100 feet away. We do have a water dispenser inside the dome that can be refilled in the bathhouse.\n\nIf you have any questions about the experience, please reach out to us before you book. This space is ideal for  one or two guests who want to spend the day exploring the local areas, or just relaxing by the river, and have a comfortable space to rest at night. \n\n\nThe Tiny Dome includes a heated blanket(cold months), Big Green Egg Grill, mini fridge/freezer, coffee pour over, filters, electric water kettle, plates, mugs, and a microwave.",
    "access": "Check-in is 3PM, checkout is 11 AM.\nThe glampground, fire pit, bathhouse, river, and all the chairs on the property are yours to enjoy! We try our best to make everyone feel welcome. Please park close to your space, and make yourself at home.\nRemember to bring firewood, charcoal, starter, etc. for your fire pit and Big Green Egg.",
    "notes": "The dome is ideal for trips spent exploring during the day and using it to rest at night. It is not climate controlled so the temperature inside can fluctuate. We do have space heaters and portable AC unit to accommodate, but please keep in mind this is glamping (like a tent!)  not a house. We are a few degrees cooler than Hiawassee due to higher elevation and tree coverage.",
    "neighborhood": "Moody Hollow is a forgotten cove, lost in time, made of circa 1950's cabins. We often refer to our street as the Magical, Mystical, Mossy, Moody Hollow. You will find gardens, swings, and friendly faces, if you walk down the end of the road and make a right you'll end up in the park area, just on the left, past another set of gardens. We live in an inclusive place that accepts everyone. High shoals Falls, Blue Hole, etc. are all just a short drive.",
    "transit": "Park in front of the rental door, please. Respect the space and keep noise low… and listen to nature at its best!\nYou can walk up Moody Hollow Road to the fun park and second set of gardens.",
    "interaction": "Each space we rent is left open for the guest and is a contactless arrival. We can have someone available as needed, but like to give guests their space. We respect each guests privacy and encourage them to reach out to us. One reason we host on Airbnb is to expand our network of awesome humans, so please don't be a stranger.",
    "house_rules": "We have 2 other rentals nearby, please be mindful of your noise and impact and keep both low.                                                 Bathhouse is shared, so respect other guests and keep it tidy and clean please.            \nPlease do not dispose of any food or trash outside. Trashcan by Bathhouse has a large bag in it, where all trash goes into.",

I absolutely love the Upstate of SC and have explored quite a bit of it extensively.  I'm always looking to create amazing guest experiences. I really enjoy the ability to share the experience of living in these great homes and the Greenville area. Definitely check with me for amazing sunset locations, where to go for superb walks, and where to have mindblowing culinary experiences!\n \nI will always try to meet your expectations and even go beyond the expectation of your stay. If you have any suggestions for me, please let me know!\n\nSome great features I have are due to the inspirations of other guests that stayed with me and had interesting ideas.

It is a lovely setting, very private, peaceful, scenic.  The host is tremendously responsive EVERY single time I had a concern or question during preparation and at the time of check-in and check-out.  When compared with other properties, the price is a little on the higher end of the scale but the TLC and thoughtfulness provided by the host, privacy of the property, and the uniqueness of the dome itself make it worth giving it a try!  We feel a 5-star review is warranted and we hope you enjoy it as much as my folks did.",

Complete with kitchen, AC & heat, dual control heated mattress pad, fully functioning bathroom, and sunrise views over the pasture. Whether you are looking to relax and enjoy feeding the farm animals, have an adventure riding the zip line, or indulge in a romantic evening sipping wine in the hot tub under the stars, you will leave with lasting memories.",
    "space": "This unique structure is a studio style living space, complete with a kitchen and full bathroom. There is a queen size bed and two very large bean bags that unfold into full size beds. The space has heat and AC, an abundance of natural light, gorgeous views of sunrise/sunset over the pasture, and an inviting covered outdoor hot tub area. The shower is stunning, with custom tile work. The space is cozy and inviting, perfect for a romantic getaway.",
    "access": "There is a gravel parking area provided for guests and a well lit walkway to the dome.",
    "notes": "Coffee, wine, and animal treats are provided. The animals love the treats and will come to the fence. Feed with hand, treat in your palm. Guests are never allowed in the pasture.",
    "neighborhood": "The Geodome is nestled in the woods overlooking the pasture filled with farm animals. There are other homes in the area. It is quiet and secluded, but conveniently located right off of a designated scenic highway. It is within 30 minutes of six state parks featuring hiking, fly fishing, mountain biking, paddle boarding, boating, and a whole lot more. \n\nTHINGS TO NOTE: \n\nThe Gedome is an uninsulated tent. While sufficient heating sources and air conditioning are provided, consistent temperature control is difficult to maintain in extreme heat or cold. In the heat of the summer, as the sun shines down on the dome, it does get extremely warm and it is difficult to cool off the space until the evening hours. We recommend exploring the lakes, trails, and surrounding area during the peak sun hours to cool off and enjoy all the mountains have to offer. During the winter, it can get very cool in the late night and early morning hours. A heated mattress pad will keep you cozy under the covers and the wood burning stove is quite effective when a fire is stoked. \n\nWhile free WiFi is provided, it is not always reliable for streaming, zoom calls, or working on a VPN due to the location.",

Currently managing properties in 13 different states. \n\nI'm a husband and father to 3 incredible little boys. My all time favorite things to do, would have to be golf, exploring a downtown area, or relaxing all day on a beach. I  love brainstorming with like-minded entrepeneurs who are enthusiastic about new opportunities, just like me. I like to make things happen! Which is why I love what I do. \n\nCurrently, I am helping homeowners from across the country manage there AirBNBs and welcome guests into their 2nd homes through BNB Breeze. We are a hands-on short term rental management company and mostly handle Airbnb listings and the logistical work that goes into managing these properties. Showcasing these properties to look their best and bring in higher returns for investors is just a small part of what I do. \n\nI'm excited to say that the company has grown to include many team members! Heather, Aj, and Barb are all working full-time to help BNBbreeze maintain all of the beautiful properties we manage. Additional part-time team members help round out our entire business. Working with with these folks is part of what makes this job so fun:)\n\nI look forward to serving you and making your Airbnb experience one you’ll love and remember for years to come!\n\nLandon",

We able to relax in the sun, near the running stream, just outside of the house. We enjoyed the grilling deck early evening, that made the rain a perfect experience, as we stayed dry while listening to the rain on the tin roof. The interior was well designed, and made our evening experiences pleasurable and different than previous rentals.\nCome fall we’ll come back to see the secluded and diverse flora again, while trying out the amazing fire pit. \nThanks for the experience!!!",

I was quite scared lol but I don’t like true adventure either lol .. hence I chose to go “glamping” rather than real camping lol. But my sister loved that part of it. So I guess it’s to each his own! \n\nOther than that… AMAZING stay!! Thank you again Vivian!",

Vivian was extremely responsive and all of her instructions were very clear and easy to understand. She even gifted us a bottle of champagne and popcorn for the outdoor movie theater! The inside of the dome was perfect! Everything was super clean, smelled amazing, and the decor was gorgeous. It was a lot bigger in there than we thought!! We were both shocked. I loved how the patio was setup. This spot was a 10 out of 10 honestly🤩We will most definitely be back. Thanks again Vivian for being such an amazing host!!",

    "summary": "Sleep the night away in this forested geodesic treehouse cluster!",
    "space": "Welcome to Dome Town! Dome town is a series of geodesic domes suspended in the trees. The domes are connected by suspension bridges that weave through the canopy. In total there are three sleeping domes, a giant canopy lounge net, and one communal water dome, where there are two full baths, and one wash station. Each dome offers a private and unique experience. Sleeping in a dome will change the way you think about square building forever! Dome town is located just a short walk away from The Rock House Cafe. There is no other treehouse dome experience quite like this. Explore the canopy, enjoy the gorge, sleep in a dome!  \r\n\r\nTurtle Dome is one of our larger domes and is located lower on the hillside, closer to the water dome. It sleeps two on a queen sized bed. It is heated and cooled, and has its own private kitchenette. Enjoy the expansive interior of the dome, green leaves through the bay window, and soft calming feel of the round space. ",
    "transit": "The domes are located up a single lane gravel county road. \r\n The water dome and other domes are connected by suspension bridges, walkways and stairs.  The outdoor lighting will be on until midnight and then we switch it off to allow the dark night forest sky to be just that--dark!  We recommend packing a flashlight or headlamp to aid in moving around after the lights are off.  ",
    "house_rules": "-Please be respectful of other Dome Town guests and keep in mind the 10 pm to 7 am quiet hours.  \r\n-Smoking is NOT allowed in our main parking lot, near our office buildings or inside of your treehouse. You may smoke outside near your treehouse, but we ask that you to be mindful of affecting others nearby.\r\n-Leave the treehouse in a similar condition to how you found it.  \r\n-Our 3% Management Fee is for our local Wolfe County Tourism Tax and this money is used locally to help encourage sustainable growth and eco-tourism in our area.  \r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nRELEASE OF LIABILITY AND INDEMNITY AGREEMENT – THE TURTLE DOME TREE HOUSE\r\n\r\nThe individual named below (referred to as \"I\" or \"me\") desires to make use of the vacation rental located at Laurel Lane, Powell County, Kentucky and known as The Turtle Dome Tree House (and more specifically described as lot 53 and 36 on the land deed) (the \"Property\") (the \"Property\") provided by The Canopy Crew, LLC, an Ohio limited liability company (the \"Company\").

First, yes you truly need a vehicle that can handle the drive in and out or at least be mindful of that.  I definitely got to use my Outback for the first time as it should be - off road vehicle.  The Dome is so beautiful and relaxing. It was so clean & fresh.  Many times we giggled to each other - “you know the statement, I feel like I’m going around in circles? Lol well I literally am in here!!” Lol.   We loved HOW close it was to everything we wanted to do. So easy to get to things so the perfect spot!  We truly will come back and stay here again!  We have been recommending this place to all our friends and family!  Great and I mean great hosts!  We learned they have other places to stay as well - so we will be checking those out too in the future! Again GREAT hosts!! Love Home Sweet Dome! Won’t regret it!",

    "summary": "A rare, elevated stay in Red River Gorge, this property offers the perfect setting for an upscale glamping experience. This newly-built dome combines modern design with earthy textures- giving you a \"home sweet home\" type feeling. Bring your crew over the river and through the woods to our 26-acres of woodlands, with free access to Spirit Lake. Located 15 mins. from Natural Bridge State Park in Daniel Boone Nat. Forest. Come hike, climb, and explore the good ole' outdoors! *4WD VEHICLES ADVISED*",
    "space": "Our property is located on a 40ft. wide deck structure, lofted 2 stories in the air! The structure is a geodesic dome, wrapped in heavy duty exterior vinyl, but finished on the inside with cozy cabin furnishings. The space has running water from our well, electricity, HVAC, a full-bathroom, and 3 beds that can accommodate up to 6 guests... plus a hottub :)",
    "access": "CONSTRUCTION UPDATE:\n\nHome Sweet Dome is the first of several exciting projects we’re working on in the area. This space is part of our \"Nature Rooms\" project in which we are in the process of developing in order to create/ craft more unique spaces for future guests to experience on the 27 acres. Because of this, we always like to inform guests that the area is in active development, so some building work may be taking place nearby during your stay. It shouldn't be very disruptive to your visit though as much of the development is reasonably spaced out !\n\nConstruction could be taking place as well as some traffic passing by the Dome area from time to time. The new build sites are mostly out of eyesight of the Dome but you may see and hear some activity as workers will be driving by entering and exiting the job site as well as constructing new domes and glass houses during typical working hours (9:00-5:00). \n\nWe assure you that we are doing all we can to make sure that your experience at Home Sweet Dome is magical, relaxing, and everything you expected and more but we always want our guests to be aware of this in case you encounter any of it over the course of your visit. In regards to the new spaces- our future domes, glass houses, and other builds are projected to be completed by this Fall. \n\n\n\n\n\nWINTER UPDATE:\n\nSince we are located in a more rural area with curvy roads, inclement weather can definitely cause problems with accessing the Dome (as it can with any home). In most circumstances, a 4WD vehicle will be able to tackle the terrain, but snow and ice is problematic. We will keep an eye out on the forecast for your stay and keep you aware of the conditions as we get closer.\n\nIn the event that inclement weather is on the horizon for your stay we will be sure to notify you. Since it will be hard to access the Dome in snowy/icy conditions, we advise cancelling/rescheduling your trip and we will happily give you a full refund in that event. There are some locals that work to clear the roadways into the development, but it’s not always a timely event, and there is a risk of getting snowed in/stuck in our cabin development- it’s happened to guests of other cabins in the past :)\n\nIn addition to the dome structure, guests are allowed access to our 26 adjoining acres (the land located just behind the unit). There are 3 unmarked hiking loops/trails around the property, so un-hinged hiking and exploring is encouraged, but please be mindful that there are no markings to navigate your way to and from the dome. Across the property are cliff edges, small caves, and even a small waterfall (located on the left side of our property). Also, each guest has free access to \"Spirit Lake\" which is located at the last fork in the road just before our property. Although swimming is not permitted in the lake- canoeing, kayaking, and fishing are allowed!",
    "notes": "Just some special little notes about the property:\n+We have walkie-talkies in the home so that you can channel your inner kiddo as you explore the woods.\n+Complementary Eno's are provided with every rental. (We even have hooking hardware located on the beams below the dome for your afternoon nap).\n+The property is located right along a babbling creek- so the setting is wonderful for soaking in some relaxing sounds.",
    "transit": "**4WD VEHICLES ADVISED - USE CAUTION**\n\nWe want ensure that all guests who book this space are prepared and safe when driving to the dome.\n\nPlease note that the road to the property is gravel and contains steep hills, curvy turns, and is narrow (please drive slow and use caution). The drive to the dome is beautiful and the property is secluded and quiet. When you get to the property, there is a small creek that guests will need to drive through to access the dome parking lot. There is also an adjacent parking lot right before the creek, so if you feel uneasy about driving across it, feel free to park in the front lot and hike across the wooden bridge to access the dome.",

Airbnb is a great platform for hosting and it’s sometimes easy to forget that someone actually built the home you’re staying in. Here the connection with nature and the little details everywhere let you know that there’s a person behind the structure. I felt right at home and it was hard to leave! There is so much to do in the nearby area and at the same time you feel secluded from the regular tourist activities. Take care of this place and it’ll take care of you!",

I’m not gonna lie I was a bit skeptical going into it as we aren’t big campers and never staying in anything like this before.  It exceeded our expectations and I left feeling like I wished I could have gotten more time to hang out there.   It was a really great experience and I highly encourage anyone reading this to check it out for yourself.  The host was also very accommodating and made us feel right at home in her place.",

The shared Game Room in the center of the property was fun. We played darts, shot pool, and played shuffleboard. It was one of the most enjoyable \"weekends away\" that we have ever had and it made our 35th wedding anniversary a unique and memorable time. \nI believe the staff went above and beyond in making our stay pleasurable. They posted yard signs near the walkway in celebration of our anniversary and even had a card for us on the table when we arrived! They were very quick to respond to our messages and very professional and accommodating in our conversations.\nI highly recommend this place and would be very happy to stay there again.",

I highly recommend this to anyone wanting to stay in the Hocking Hills area.  The dome had everything we needed and the bed was super comfortable!  The hot tub was just what we needed after a long day of exploring and riding on our motorcycle.  The fire ring was a very nice touch and Alissa even recommended someone to deliver firewood to us as well.  The game room was  such a nice surprise!  We played pool and shuffleboard and it was a nice little area to unwind!  We would definitely stay here again the next time we are in the area!  You won't be disappointed!

The actual space was  beautiful, unique, intimate, and aesthetically pleasing. The surroundings were gorgeous. All amenities listed were present AND working. Also, the pole barn game room was great! If you're considering this airbnb BOOK IT! They also impressed me with a personal touch - I booked this as part of a bday trip for my boyfriend, and when we arrived there was a Happy Birthday sign outside and a card in the welcome basket. I will be coming back 🙂",

Very clean with fresh linens. I am obsessed with lighting and the lighting was awesome.\nIt was so relaxing with the fire ring and hot tub (also very clean). The bed was comfortable. We slept very well.\nLocation was perfect with privacy, peace, and quiet.\nThe pole barn with the game room is an added bonus. We played shuffle board, pool, and darts. It is nicely set up as a community hangout spot with a TV. as well. \nI was in communications with Alissa a month prior, during, and after our stay \nShe is very responsive and personable. This place nailed it!!!\nWe would definitely stay again.\nTHANK YOU 🤗",

    "summary": "Enjoy a restorative and Earth-friendly luxury camping experience situated on our quiet farm about an hour drive from major cities (DMV, Baltimore, Philly). Our 300 sq ft Strawberry Hill Getaway Dome boasts a king size memory foam mattress, fluffy towels, a hot shower -- all while being immersed in nature, close to countless hikes, under twinkling stars, warmed by a toasty campfire. This is the wonderful getaway for couples, small group of friends & individuals.",
    "space": "Disclaimers:\n+ There is a beautiful stone home on the same property. Three lovely gentlemen (including my father) live there. They are very friendly and kind. \n+ We did our best to seal the dome but there may be bugs because of the proximity to nature. \n+ We have a compost toilet we will send videos and instruction on how to use. We ask you follow the direction perfectly for the best experience. It's not hard just different. \n+ It can get very hot (summer) or cold (winter) in the dome because of the lack of insulation. Please prepare for this. \n+ There is a main road about 1/2 a mile away which can cause some background noise during the night. We provide sleeping earplugs for those who prefer more quiet. \n\nSTRAWBERRY HILL DOME/ BEDROOM\n+ 12\" Memory Foam King Size Bed\n+ Lux Hotel Sheets and Pillows\n+ Star-gazing windows, so you can greet blue skies, watch the rain during a storm and peer at the stars at night\n+ Japanese Tea Table for mindful practices\n+ Games and Books for nature lovers\n\nKITCHEN / COOKING\n+ Weber Propane Grill (3 burners, grill tools included)\n+ Campstove (2 burners)\n+ Outdoor Sink\n+ All the appliances of a basic kitchen (olive oil + spices, cooking and eating utensils, cutting boards, knives, pans, pot, plates, bowls)\n+ Coffee, Tea, Sugar, Creamer, etc.\nHowever, we DO NOT have a refrigerator or cooler on site, but you could get fresh groceries or ice within 15 min.\n\nBATHROOM\nIt's outdoors, situated under the shade and protection of pine trees.\n+ Compost Toilet (great for Earth, and not as scary as it sounds :) -- don't worry we provide instructions on how to use this, and it doesn't stink!)\n+ Hot Water for Showering\n+ Public Goods Shampoo, Conditioner & Body Wash\n+ Running and Potable Water\n\nOUTDOOR SPACES\nThe Dome is situated on Strawberry Hill overlooking the farm, which we're slowly transforming into an orchard and rewilding with native trees and wildflowers. See if you notice any wild flower patches or the beginnings of one. This property has a stone house on the same acre so it is private but the house is only 50 yards away.\n+ Outdoor Seating for 4\n+ Fire pit (we provide firewood too)\n+ You're free to roam the farm up to the creek and tree line at the bottom of the hill",
    "access": "Strawberry Hill Dome, outdoor patio, outdoor bathroom are entirely private for you! You are welcome to explore the fields and gardens. Watch where you step! There are many things growing.",
    "notes": "We have one king bed. For extra guests we'd recommend bringing an air mattress or sleeping pad. We have some extra linens as well, but not in every size.",
    "neighborhood": "LOCATION\nWe are 1.5 hours from DC, 1 hour from Baltimore, 1 hour from Philly, 15 min from Newark, 12 min from UDel, \n\nTHINGS TO DO \nThere's a lot of nature, farms and a growing brewery scene.\n- Fair Hill (8 min drive) - Lots of hiking, mountain biking, rare birds, water\n- Milburn Orchard (9 min) - Pick-your-own family farm. Apples, berries and more. \n- Walnut Springs Farm (7 min)- Pick-your-own family farm. Blueberries and black raspberries. \n- Vahalla Brewing Company (8 min) -  Craft brews, live entertainment, and a kitchen that’s open nightly.\n- 1723 Vineyards (11 min) - New winery, family friendly.\n- Maryland Beer Company (12 min) - Craft brews, food truck dining, and the space is dog-friendly.\n- Elk River Brewing Company (14 min) - Craft brews with someone for everyone, serving local wines as well.\n- Dove Valley Wine (14 min) - Tasty wines and beautiful outdoors.",
    "transit": "Park up the the driveway by the dome. \nYou can wander the grounds by foot (walking around the farm and down to the creek). To go on longer hikes, you'll need  a car though.",
    "house_rules": "- *Booking guest need to be of the age of 25 or older*\n\n- Absolutely No Parties Allowed!!! Any parties will result in immediate cancellation of reservation with no REFUND!\n\n- Maximum occupancy will be 2 guests at ALL times. Any additional guests not stated in the reservation will incur a charge of $50 per night for each extra guest.\n\n- Property strictly enforced quiet hours between 10PM and 8AM. There is a residential home on the property with permanent residents. No loud music, voices, or any other loud noises allowed during quiet hours. Please be respectful of the permanent residents who are your neighbors at all times. \n\n- Smoking in or within 10 feet of the dome will incur a fee of at least $250 or the actual cost of remediation, whichever is higher.\n\n- No illicit drug use or underage drinking.\n\n- Let us know if you are bringing a pet or pets and what kind you have.\n\n- Wipe your pet(s)' paws before they enter the dome. We've provided some rags and towels for this purpose. \n\n- Pick up after your pet(s)' droppings.\n\n- Remove shoes inside the dome. We provided a bin at the doorway if you'd like your shoes to be in the dome, rather than outside.\n\n- Do NOT leave open food in the dome. It will attract ants and other pests. \n\n- Do NOT put diapers, wipes, pad or tampons into the toilet. They will NOT decompose as this is a compost toilet. We provided a separate trash bin for this. \n\n- Do NOT wash shaved hair or food waste down the sink. We provide a compost bin on the property behind the pull up bar with the blue posts -- it's past the bathroom, near the long term residents' parking.\n\n- Shut the door of the dome when vacating. \n\n- Please wipe you pet's paws before coming into the dome. \n\n- Ensure all propane tanks that you used for cooking (camp stove, grill) are shut after usage.\n\nThis is a luxury camping experience. We offer an experience to unwind and be immersed in wonderful nature. We do not have AC, wifi, or a flushing toilet. Please also note that bugs get into our getaway dome. We use treatments that are safe for pets and humans around the tent, which reduces them, but not 100%. We have a fan in the dome to circulate air in addition to the breeze at the hilltop, and we have a compost toilet.",

It is a stunning way to disconnect from the world in style with perfect 5 star hotel glamping amenities. Love that there is a private gated entrance up the mountain giving it that extra exclusiveness feel. Private hot tub preset and always hot along with a gas fire pit. Linens and bathroom were very nice but again that gorgeous view to fall asleep to and wake up to is where it is at. Ingles is a grocery store with gas at the bottom of the mountain your staying on - about 6 min away and it is all right off the highway. Perfect easy location. Dog friendly. Thank you for a great sister’s retreat.",

The geodomes are designed & decorated beautifully, with modern touches & amenities. The kitchenette contained everything needed. The bed was super comfy & waking up to that expansive, open view of the mountains was an experience. Everything was just absolutely wonderful! We certainly enjoyed the hot tub & deck too!! Can't say enough about this place. The hosts were great too! Easy to communicate & willing to accommodate. We will be back!!",

    "space": "Geodesic Dome Home #5 features a massive, handcrafted king-size barnwood bed that is positioned to provide incredible views of the surrounding pristine forest.  A dividing wall separates the bedroom and living room.  The living room space has two chairs and a coffee table.  Should it rain, there is a TV to stream your favorite movie.  There is a private, indoor bathroom and kitchen. The bathroom has a full-size tub and shower.\n\nOutside you will find a second bathtub.

We provide one complimentary bundle of firewood for each day booked.  \n\nWith 75 acres of private land surrounded by state land on three sides, you will have access to miles of trails for hiking and birding.  Pine, cedar, spruce, and cherry trees provide a natural privacy barrier from neighboring accommodations.  Neighboring accommodations range from 80' to 300' away.  Please be careful driving in or out in the evening as there is an abundance of deer and other wildlife in the area.  We seek to provide you with a unique, intimate interaction with nature, yet you are only a few miles away from the best of Traverse City.",
    "neighborhood": "Near By Destinations\n\nThe Silver Birch Resort is located just a few miles from dozens of attractions.\n\nHorse Show – Traverse City Horse Shows is 3 miles away.  Shows run from June until September.  Check their website for show days and hours\n\nBeaches & Swimming – some of Traverse City’s finest beaches are only 5 miles away on East Bay (due west until you dead end into US31, turn left and immediately turn right.\n\nWine Tasting – Traverse City’s reputation for producing world-class wines is quickly growing as many of the wineries have been winning awards. Most of these wineries call Old Mission Peninsula home. Even if wine is not your on To Do list, the drive through the rolling hills of the peninsula will provide breathtaking views of East and West Bays. The mouth of the peninsula is approximately 10 miles from Silver Birch Resort. After sampling the wonderful wines, you might as well drive to the northernmost point of the peninsula and visit Mission Point Lighthouse.\n\nBreweries – Traverse City and the surrounding areas have a plethora of micro-breweries featuring locally grown hops. Some of our favorites include Shorts Brewery and Stone Hound Brewing Company. Please note: the owners believe in constantly checking the quality of all our local beers. We have never had a bad beer in any of the dozen downtown breweries.\n\nShorts Brewery – 211 Industrial Park Drive, Elk Rapids, MI 49629\nStone Hound Brewery – 3593 Bunker Hill Rd, Williamsburg, MI 49690\n\nShopping – downtown Traverse City with street after street of unique gift shops, clothing boutiques, restaurants, and bistros is only 11 miles away.\n\nElk Rapids – charming Elk Rapids is only 20 miles away. Would you like to see a real-life “Norman Rockwell” town? It doesn’t get any better than this. The beaches are some of the finest in northern Michigan, but sharing this secret will get us in trouble with many of the locals who refuse to tell visitors about Elk Rapids for not wanting to see it lose its “yesterday” charm. Please don’t tell anyone where you got this information. Elk Rapids also has an authentic single-screen movie theatre that was built in the early nineteenth century. You will feel like you are stepping back to a bygone era. The popcorn, root beer & cherry soda is some of the best you’ve ever had. If a movie is desired, be sure to bring cash as twenty-first-century plastic is not accepted. All employees are committed to keeping the old-fashioned movie experience authentic.\n\nRestaurants\n\nBoth Traverse City and Elk Rapids are considered “foodie” towns. Restaurants in our area that serve mediocre food do not last long. Just about every restaurant in this area has good quality food. Some of the owners’ favorites are:\n\nHopscotch Brick Oven & Taproom\n2032 US-31, Traverse City, MI 49686\n\nRed Ginger is located in downtown Traverse City. If you like calamari, you must try the appetizer.\n237 E Front St, Traverse City, MI 49684\n\nRed Mesa on US31 offers Mexican/Spanish dishes.\n1544 US-31 N, Traverse City, MI 49686\n\nPearls in Elk Rapids specializes in Louisiana Cajun cooking.\n617 Ames St, Elk Rapids, MI 49629\n\nMcGee’s in Acme. The closest restaurant and only four miles away.\n4341 M-72, Williamsburg, MI 49690\n\nJolly Pumpkin on Old Mission Peninsula.\n13512 Peninsula Dr, Traverse City, MI 49686\n\nDon's Drive Inn. 50's diner theme with great burgers and killer milkshakes.\n2030 US 31 N., Traverse City, MI 49686\n\nPizza Options\nEast Bay Pizza – In our opinion, the best pizza (partly because the owner’s brother operates it) is East Bay Pizza. Their pizza is outstanding and dining in will also give you one of the best views of the Bay. They also serve 30 flavors of Moomer’s Ice Cream. Moomers won the title of Best Ice Cream in America in a contest sponsored by Good Morning American. A perfect summer night in northern Michigan is defined by a good pizza, ice cream, and breathtaking sunsets on the Bay. East Bay Pizza has all three.\n4386 US-31, Traverse City, MI 49686\n\nThat’s A Pizza – want to eat in? That’s A Pizza will deliver right to your site. This was the owner’s favorite pizza place until his brother opened. They have excellent pizza and a great staff.\n5430 US-31, Williamsburg, MI 49690\n\nSleeping Bear Sand Dunes – named by Good Morning American as “The Most Beautiful Place in America”. People come from all over the world (no joke, Sleeping Bear sees tens of thousands of visitors from Europe and Japan who travel specifically to see the sand dunes. Expending a little energy and climbing the dunes affords you unbelievable views of Lake Michigan and surrounding lakes. You will quickly realize why Good Morning American bestowed this title. The Sleeping Bear Sand Dunes are approximately 36 miles away.\n\nCharlevoix, Michigan – another wonderful, charming town with great restaurants, shopping, and breathtaking views.\n\nGolfing – we are located near three of Michigan’s finest golf courses: The Bear, The Wolverine, and LochenHeath. Check out their websites for all the awards and reviews. These golf courses are only 4 miles away.\n\nThe Bear, The Wolverine, and LochenHeath\n\nTurtle Creek Casino –   If you enjoy the excitement of gambling and the nightlife, you will only be 1.5 miles away from the beautiful Turtle Creek Casino.  In addition to your favorite games, there is a fine restaurant and club with music and dancing.",
    "house_rules": "PET POLICY\n\nWe are dog lovers.  We have two of our own.  We did realize at the end of last year that we must put a pet policy in place. A guest last year left their dog all day in the dome, and it barked the entire time they were gone disrupting the experience of other guests.  This was a dog with a deep, loud bark.  The dog barked for eight hours straight which was impressive as you would think it would lose its voice after a few hours.  Everyone’s nerves were fried by the time the people returned. \n\nWe recently had a guest that asked if they could bring their dog. Even after reading this policy, they let their dog bark for almost an hour. It was not continuous, but it was 5 to 10 seconds of stressed-out, loud barking, and then silence. Every 5-10 minutes there was a barking outburst. I think they tied it up outside, and it wanted to come in the side. The dog was trying to get their attention.  I really did not want to have to walk down there and have a talk with them as we are trying for everyone to have a nice experience. I was very close to walking to their site, and then it stopped for the evening. The problem is the other five domes in the area. This had to disrupt their barbecues, campfires, and evening.\n \nEveryone knows their dogs.  Our two dogs would not bark if we left them somewhere unless they were startled.  This is understandable and acceptable.  If you have a dog that will bark from separation anxiety, we ask that he/she not be left alone (or outside alone while the family is indoors).  If you feel, the dog would only bark if startled, then we are fine with a dog.  If you are going to leave for a few hours, we ask that it be kenneled and left in the kitchen/bath structure – NOT left in the dome.  The kitchen/bath structure has more insulation, and the occasional bark will not travel through the entire property. \n\nThe other requirement we have for pets is that they are not allowed on the beds. We have already had to replace two comforters this year because we were not able to get the dog hair out. Please try and bring a dog bed.  If you cannot, we leave an extra sheet in the dresser drawer. This is specifically for your dog. You can lay this on the floor in an area and your pet is welcome to sleep on this. Dog hair on the comforter is subject to a $100 replacement fee.\n \nIf you agree to these pet policies, you are welcome to bring your dog.  \n\nWe are located on 75 acres and surrounded by thousands of acres of state forestry with trails. You can walk for miles and miles.  This is the perfect property to take your dog for a nice long walk.  If he or she will run after a deer, fox, raccoon, or porcupine, then we strongly suggest a lease as you are sure to see wildlife.",

If you have a friend who would like to join, they are welcome to lay a pad on the wood floor or pitch a tent on the cleared area by the fire pit (max of 2 additional guests).\n\nKITCHEN -- You will have a gas grill & side burner cooking setup with two 7-gallon water jugs, sink basin, and a 55-quart cooler pre-filled with ice.\n\nPOWER -- 1000Wh portable solar battery + 400W of solar panels provide power for charging devices, lights, and a standing fan.\n\nHEAT - There is a propane heater that will keep the dome warm at night, but no permanent heating system.\n\nBATHROOM -- About 3 mins walk from the dome, there's an outhouse stocked with toilet paper & hand sanitizer by the parking area! This is shared with Gnome's Yome guests. It is on your left as you pull into the parking area, about 100 ft down a trail.\n\nACCESS -- You will park about 150 ft away from the dome and hike uphill to it via a fairy-lit trail through the forest. NOTE you will drive on a mile of gravel road to get to the property that can be rough in a few areas. There is nothing steep, just chewed up and bumpy. (take it slow and you should be fine).\n\nFIRE -- Fires are allowed in the fire ring only. Gather your own fire material from the site or purchase firewood from Walmart to make things easy!\n\nTO-BRING-LIST: \n- Sturdy shoes or boots (Chaco folks, strap up!)\n- Reusable water bottle\n- Headlamp\n- Extra layer or two\n- Bug spray\n\nLOCATION: Crabtree Falls, Grassy Creek Falls, & Tom's Creek Falls all within a 15-min drive. Take our favorite stretch of the Blue Ridge Parkway to Linville Gorge - 25 mins to Linville Falls, Babel Tower, and Wisemann's View! Or head the other way to the tallest peak East of the Mississippi, Mt. Mitchell.",

It was a great weekend away to celebrate my 40th with some of my closest friends and everybody had the best weekend there. The house was spotless upon arrival, amenities were great, the beds were extremely comfortable, and the back patio that sits on top of the hill was beyond perfect for our nightly bonfires and letting our pups run around and enjoy the property while we played whiffle ball. I want to thank Michell for making our weekend so memorable and, honestly, making a dream of mine come true by being able to stay at this property after all of these years. I will definitely be back!!!",

They provided lots of information and instructions on how to get along in the space and responded quickly if we had questions. \nThere were thoughtful amenities included with the dome (ex: wood splitting stand with hammer, slippers, bug spray, first aid kit...). It really shows that Wild Maple Acres put the effort into our stay. \nThe dome experience however was slightly weather pending. Under heavy rains, some water seeps into the living space and the dome gets quite humid. However, we were able to cut the humidity with the super efficient wood stove. \nAll in all it was a great and unique experience, and we'd recommend it!",

The place is absolutely adorable and peaceful ! Great first time Glamping experience away from the city life. Only thing I wish the showers were covered a bit more, and the washrooms smelled really bad due to no drainage system. Other then that everything was amazing! Definitely recommend!",

My husband and I had a wonderful time, felt comfortable, and had everything we needed. The paddleboards and paddle boat were an added bonus.  Great hiking and PJP path for biking were close by and easy to access. The addition of some lounge chairs outside are the only thing I can think of that would have been nice to have.  We will definitely be back!!",

The sheep were absolutely adorable and followed us along the fence line all the way back to the car upon our departure. We will be coming back, probably for a longer stay next time!",

Everything inside the dome was so thoughtfully designed. 2 lanterns, a portable fan (definitely a must have when glamming in July) and such cute games. Loved staying here and getting to explore the property a bit and having the space to connect with nature. Definitely rebooking in the fall!",

    "summary": "Unplug from your busy life and reconnect with nature in this brand new glamping dome experience - complete with a cozy king size bed, wood fired cedar hot tub, composting toilet, and picnic table. Enjoy the nature path as it leads to a grassy clearing with a fire pit and Adirondack chairs. You will have two heavily wooded, fenced in acres all to yourself with clearings for the dome, tub and fire pit. We provide water via a large water cooler, and bright, cheery lantern-style flashlights at night",
    "space": "This peaceful dome is completely off the grid- truly an escape and chance to pause, breathe, and recharge. We do provide strong Wi-Fi should you choose to watch movies on your laptop or phone. There is a charging station available to charge your phone or laptop. Use the propane stove to quickly heat water for (included) tea or coffee, or scramble some fresh, free range (seasonally included!) chicken eggs. A large water cooler provides plenty of fresh drinking water. The composting toilet is conveniently located immediately behind the dome, and there’s an included shower bag that will heat water for a “sun shower.” Enjoy a relaxing soak in the wood-fired cedar soaking tub that is frequently tested and sanitized only by Ah Natural mineral hot tub sanitizer (no chlorine or bromine smell, no burning eyes…) and take a relaxing walk on the 1/3 mile hiking trail, ending in a clearing with a fire pit and wooden swing. There are a few neighbors surrounding our property but you can barely catch glimpses of their homes or lights through the forest, especially spring-fall.",
    "access": "Everything inside the fenced area is yours to explore! Two acres of forests, streams, shaded paths and privacy. Perch atop the large boulder for a gorgeous view of the two intersecting streams. Livestock are contained on the opposite sides of many of the fences- feel free to offer treats to the sheep, horses and chickens (included in labeled jars.) Keep your palm flat when offering the treat! You can scatter grain for the chickens as well- but no guarantees the chickens will stay within the fences. Our chickens enjoy true free-range status.",
    "notes": "The wood fired cedar hot tub takes a couple of  hours to heat up and needs tending when you first light it so the fire doesn’t die out. You will be the one building the fire inside the internal oven, but we’re happy to provide directions and suggestions. All supplies, kindling and firewood that you need to heat up the soaking tub are provided, but it can be a bit tricky to get started at first- if you have questions or run into issues, feel free to text! \n\nWe also provide wood for the fire pit in the clearing. If you need more wood than what we’ve supplied, we can bring you additional firewood for a $10 charge. \n\nWe have sheep, horses and chickens roaming the property full time, and there are chicks and lambs born every year, typically in the spring and summer months. Feel free to feed them the treats provided, they are used to humans. However, animals are unpredictable- interact at your own risk :)\n\nThe Dome is located just minutes from downtown Travelers Rest, with a variety of wonderful restaurants, breweries, and cute local shops.\n\nThere are also more hiking trails and waterfall viewing experiences than I can list extremely conveniently located a short drive away. If you enjoy bicycling, the Swamp Rabbit Trail is a ten minute drive away. Don’t have a bike? Sunrift Adventures in downtown Travelers Rest will hook you up.",
    "neighborhood": "You may be able to see glimpses of a few homes through the woods at some vantage points. However, the location is generally secluded and private. Nonetheless, please avoid being intentionally excessively loud or disruptive!",
    "transit": "Park in your own graveled space and  entrance, then take a 800 foot walk to the dome down a grassy path. There will be a cart provided to tote your luggage. Enjoy these steps into nature and away from the day-to-day!",
    "interaction": "You can call or text my cell number if you need anything during your stay. If you want to be left totally alone, that’s completely fine as well! I’m available if you need assistance but otherwise enjoy your peace and solitude.",
    "house_rules": "Please avoid excessive noise, especially after dark!",

The day we arrived it rained and there was no way I would have walked from the bottom of the hill to the Geo Dome carrying all my stuff (luggage, cooler, etc.). It was pouring down rain and the road was very rocky, unlevel, with lots of high and low spots which made it difficult to navigate. It was also very slippery and muddy, which he did say, but you don’t realize how bad it is until you actually have to go up it. Thank goodness for my four wheel drive truck! I can’t even imagine walking up that on a wet rainy or dry day! The Geo Dome itself was very nice inside. We could not get the hot water to work and to be honest we didn’t even bother to call for help with it, because we had other family staying in the area so we just bathed at their rental.

We booked this because the uniqueness of the space matched our aesthetic, however, we were in for much more than what we imagined. Firstly, everything is exactly how it looks in the photos, yet somehow even better in person. The geometry of the space carries a comforting energy that is unlike that of being in a traditional rectangular home. It's something you have to experience beyond words. It adds to the additional layer of being nestled in the woods. What was also impressive was the intelligent design of the living space. Although it's one big open dome, the layout of each section of the home still feels like its own individual space, simultaneously connected to other parts of the - again, something you must experience to understand the paradox. Overall It was an excellent 5-day getaway from city life. Thank you Maddie!",

The bedding was upscale and comfortable. Upon our arrival, essential oils were being infused and bedside lamps turned on. The home was immaculate. We enjoyed exploring every nook and cranny of this fabulous geodesic dome. The deck was peaceful and a perfect place for coffee in the morning and wine in the evening. \nThe location is 4 minutes from Amicalola Falls- where we enjoyed a wonderful hike to the top. We also visited Monteluce Winery for a wine tasting and charcuterie and dinner.\n I hope to visit again during apple picking season. I think any season will be amazing at the ga mountain dome home. \nThank you Maddie for taking care of us and looking after every detail. You and Ben are great hosts!",

    "summary": "Tons of fun details make this secluded, freshly renovated 1984 geodesic dome a true vacation paradise, while the amenities (modern kitchen, laundry, A/C, and internet) will make you feel right at home!\n \nEnjoy your coffee from the private wraparound deck overlooking Amicolola State Falls Park, or stoke the wood fire in the living room to warm up during the winter. Stay as a romantic getaway for two or grab your friends and rent the attached 1BR/1BA cottage with king bed & trundle day bed.",
    "space": "DOME & COTTAGE\n\nThe dome boasts an open floor plan on the main that feels much roomier than its 1200 square feet. The upstairs hosts 1 private bedroom with king bed and 1 lofted semi-private queen bed sleeping area, comfortably sleeping 4 total. \n \nThe cottage (connected by the same wrap-around deck) includes 1 studio style apartment with 1 king bed and full private bathroom.\n \nThe house comes equipped with all the modern conveniences: the best internet money can buy in the woods (good for streaming and video conferencing), a brand new Frame TV, a bluetooth speaker, a french press coffee station in the cottage and electronic key access for easy self check-in.\n \nThe dining room table seats 6 for easy meals & games, the vintage Eames chair upstairs is conveniently located in a lofted nook with the bookshelf, and the whole gang can cozy up on one of two couches for movie night.\n \nThe yard is very private and wooded - perfect for a true getaway (that is 10 minutes from restaurants, wineries, apple orchards, and more) and complete with outdoor wood & gas fireplaces.\n \nYou’ll feel at home in the fully-stocked kitchen. An array of kitchen tools, pots, and pans are complemented by a microwave, coffee maker, coffee grinder. We try to maintain a decent supply of basics (olive oil, coffee filters, spices, salt & pepper), but IGA about 10 minutes away has an array of groceries if you’re in need of something particular. We also always have cocktail glasses on hand.",
    "access": "Guests will have private access to the dome + cottage with their rental. The original barn on the property and the interior ladder leading up to the cupola are both not accessible to guests.",
    "notes": "Looking for things to do? During the day, your options are endless… \n- Enjoy several local wineries, all within 15 minutes of your stay (Fainting Goat Vineyards, Cartecay Vineyards, Chateau Meichtry Family Vineyard and Winery)\n- Make a reservation at Big Canoe's finest Home Restaurant (Alex will take good care of you) or enjoy delicious cocktails from Matt at the bar\n- Pick apples at B.J. Reece Orchard or R & A Orchards\n \nAfter a long day, you’ll love enjoying a glass of wine by the indoor wood fireplace or outside on the wrap-around deck with gas fireplace.\n \nWe believe in an environment of inclusivity and diversity and have done our best to ensure everyone feels welcome here!\n \nOther things to note\n***While we love welcoming kids of all ages we encourage adults to take a second look at the open stairs and wide minimal railings on the loft before they confirm their reservation.\n \nThe dome sits on a roundabout driveway that can comfortably fit 4-5 cars.\n \nCheck us out and tag us on IG @gamountaindomehome",

The only recommendations we have is to download your own shows on your personal devices because sometimes the internet isn’t stellar and life would be easier if you have episodes download for your viewing pleasure.  We loved the full kitchen and ability to grill, the coffee station and really had fun laughing while we did face masks together! They really had everything to make us feel like we were on a mini retreat away to celebrate our 15 years married together!",

There was no view through the top of the dome but my guess would be it’s because there may have been extra insulation for the heat. It should still be disclosed. The swings were also completely blocked by very large weeds so they are essentially unusable. \nThe biggest problem, however, was we tried to use the hot tub which was murky - but thought it may be okay. After turning on the jets, we quickly found it was actually dirty due to black scum forming on top.

    "summary": "Tennessee Glamping’s geodesic dome, as featured on DIY Network’s “Building off the Grid,” is nestled on a mountaintop and 16 acres of secluded property. The perfect place to take in remarkable mountain views and dreamlike starry nights. Peace and tranquility are abundant, as are amenities typically missing with traditional camping.",
    "space": "The 450 square foot dome provides guests with a fully functioning bathroom equipped with a toilet, sink, and shower. The convenient kitchen, with refrigerator and sink, an outdoor grill, and fire pit allow for multiple dining prep options. HVAC keeps the inside of the dome cozy or cool, allowing you to relax at your perfect temperature. Enjoy the wrap around deck with a fire pit and hot tub, and don’t forget to enjoy the swings below. An incredible 40’ rock bluff sits behind the dome along with an additional fire pit with chairs. Fiery Gizzard Trail, Foster Falls, and Cumberland Caverns are all nearby as well as numerous local trails.",

Kelsey is an excellent chef and leaves the fridge stocked with all sorts of goodies for your stay. The bed was incredibly comfortable and the linens very clean. The bathroom was spotless and the shower has great pressure and got nice and hot. She provides everything you could want from shampoo, to a hair dryer, to paper goods and utensils. Even salt and pepper! The hot tub was clean and hot. The fire pit was stocked with plenty of free wood and the views were amazing. This is my first time glamping and I can’t wait to do it again but man are my expectations high after this!! You are just a short drive to Sleeping Bear Dunes with some of the best views I’ve ever seen. Last tip - order one of LRHs pizzas, you won’t be disappointed!",

Kelsey and Seth (and their dog Snuffleupagus) were the best hosts. Their hospitality was unmatched and they have thought of so many little details to make this place such a beautiful retreat. The pictures of this place in the listing simply do not do it justice. The location is great - nearby to both Sleeping Bear Dunes and Traverse City. You can really create your own experience with your stay. The grounds itself are beautiful. The communal dining area/gardens, bonfire pit and hot tub are all very well maintained. You don't feel like you are on top of other guests staying at the homestead and it is very quiet. We would recommend this place to anyone looking for a peaceful getaway. We look forward to coming back soon!",

The wifi wasn’t the strongest but it was good enough in case you need it, and it’s an incentive to unplug.

He’s the best host I’ve seen on here and if we go back to West Virginia I won’t be staying anywhere else!! I highly recommend this house.

    "summary": "Stay on a 140 acre farm in the only camping dome shelter location in the Smoky Mountains and get back to nature! Look out the windows at the forest, mountaintop and sky. Relax on the little porch and enjoy the warm propane fire pit. Lay down in the comfy queen sized bed and drift off to sleep while watching the beauty of the night sky!",
    "space": "Come visit this unique camping dome in the Smoky Mountains! See the night sky from your bed and enjoy being close to nature. This is a Glamping experience. Glamping is luxurious camping with more modern amenities like electricity, finished floors, beautiful views, and comfortable furnishings, but it is still camping. The domes are not insulated so it can get hot during the day in the summer and cold at night in the winter. There is an A/C unit and a heater in the unit, as well as a heated blanket, but similar to camping, expect the weather to be a factor. Explore Tennessee by day and relax in your dome at night. The dome has a large bay window and several sky windows. You’ll find a barn with an apartment, a tiny house, and three other domes on the property. Inside the barn, we have indoor showers and bathrooms. There is also a mini fridge, microwave, and coffee maker available for all guests to use.Additionally, we also have an outdoor shower, but it will be shut off during winter months. There is also a propane fireplace to enjoy s'mores or hotdogs at night. \n\nPET POLICY: We are pet friendly and understand pets are part of the family. We gladly welcome our guests traveling with pets. There will be a $20 fee per stay for each pet. Pet's MAY NOT be left unattended in the dome or on the property. Guests are liable for any damages done by their animal during their stay.",
    "access": "Dome, porch and propane fire pit are just for you. Park in the gravel driveway right near the dome. Shower and portable toilet are shared if there are guests in the the other domes and tiny house.",
    "notes": "The dome is not insulated so it can get hot during the day in the summer and cold at night in the winter. There is an A/C unit and a heater in the dome, as well as a heated blanket, but similar to camping, expect the weather to be a factor.\n\nVerizon is the only service provider that works here. We do provide Wi-fi on site, but it is spotty around the property, but can be used to check email or send imessages. If you are unable to access Wi-Fi at your dome, you can use the guest area in the passway of the barn to access a stronger WiFi signal. \n\nThere is no plumbing inside the domes. Bathrooms and showers are provided onsite and are shared with other guests.",

The hosts are so accommodating and lovely - they made every effort to make us comfortable. I cannot say enough about this place and these hosts.",

AirBnB is in a lovely town with very kind locals and fun outdoor activities - 4x4 on beach, kayaking, kitesurfing, jet skiing, surfing. We were able to walk to beaches, a local grocery / deli, and restaurants. The nearby beach was perfect for our little one and allowed seasonal bonfires. The host was incredibly kind, and shared recommendations for local restaurants and golf courses! Absolutely the perfect location for new parents to celebrate our first Father’s Day, and get some much needed R&R!",

    "summary": "Featured on Conde Nast Traveler as one of the best OBX rentals of 2021!\n\nTons of fun details make this secluded, freshly renovated 1971 geodesic dome a true vacation paradise, while the amenities (fully equipped kitchen, laundry, A/C, and high-speed internet) will make you feel right at home! \n\nEnjoy your coffee from the private wraparound deck, with the sounds of the sea and the breeze through the marsh grasses, or take a ten minute stroll across the dune to catch the sunrise over the Atlantic.",
    "space": "The space boasts an open floor plan that feels much roomier than its 1100 square feet. Two queen bedrooms downstairs and two semi-private sleeping areas upstairs in the loft - one with a queen bed and one with a twin bed - comfortably sleep seven. \n\nThe house comes equipped with all the modern conveniences: the best internet money can buy on the OBX (good for streaming and video conferencing), a brand new Smart TV pre-loaded with Netflix (anything else can be streamed from your phone or laptop), a bluetooth speaker, Nest smart thermostat, and electronic key access for easy self check-in.\n\nThe huge, locally-made live-edge table is perfect for meals and games, the vintage peacock chair is conveniently located in a nook with the bookshelf, and the whole gang can cozy up on the large wrap-around sectional for movie night.\n\nThere are two full bathrooms (one on each floor), a custom built, eat-in kitchen, and a wrap-around deck overlooking protected marshland where you can enjoy the sounds of birds in the morning and tree frogs at night.\n\nThe yard is very private and beautifully landscaped with coastal flowers and trees. Downstairs, wide-plank decking connects the laundry room, lockable storage for your beach gear, a covered clothesline to dry your beach towels, and a fish-cleaning table for the catch of the day.\n\nYou’ll feel at home in the fully-stocked kitchen. A wide array of kitchen tools, pots, and pans are complemented by a toaster oven, microwave, coffee maker, coffee grinder, electric kettle, and SodaStream (be sure to bring a CO2 cartridge in case the last one is out). We try to maintain a decent supply of basics (olive oil, coffee filters, spices, salt & pepper), but Waves Deli around the corner has an impressive array of groceries if you’re in need of something particular.\n\nLooking for things to do? During the day, your options are endless… relax on the beach, enjoy local shops, grab sandwiches and beverages at the gourmet deli/grocery, or take advantage of one of the top five kitesurfing locations in the world… all within short walking distance of your home base. In the evening, enjoy the stars from the deck or drinks and live music at Waterman’s… or both!\n\nAfter a long day, you’ll love sinking into one of our comfortable beds… we’re big believers that sleep on vacation shouldn’t be compromised by “renter-grade” mattresses and linens!\n\nWe believe in an environment of inclusivity and diversity and have done our best to ensure everyone feel welcome here!",
    "notes": "***While we love welcoming kids of all ages we encourage adults to take a second look at the open stairs and wide minimal railings on the loft before they confirm their reservation. \n\nThere's no street parking on our road and our home only accommodates three cars (two on the driveway, and one parallel parked on the road. \n\nCheck us out and tag us on IG @sunnysideup.nc",
    "neighborhood": "A centrally-located tree-lined cul-de-sac with private beach access, this quiet residential street is known to locals as the best on the outer banks.",
    "transit": "There's only parking for three vehicles on property, but you won’t need more than that while you’re here! You’re a short walk to anywhere in Salvo, and we’ve got three beach cruisers available for you to use if you’d like to explore further (BYO helmets!)",
    "interaction": "You'll have the house all to yourself for your stay, but we're just a quick phone call or text away if you need anything!",
    "house_rules": "1. No parties, events, or unregistered guests are allowed \n2. This is a no smoking, and vaping property\n3. No commercial uses \n4. No candles, open flames, or confetti\n5. Quiet hours = 10pm-8am \n\n***You may get approval to visit with one well behaved dog. As a guest you must have previous positive reviews. We love dogs but have had really unfortunate experiences hosting them in the past so please speak to us about yours before traveling with them.",

I recently sold Bellanina Day Spa & Institute in Ann Arbor, so now I spend more time creating beauty in art and interior design and enjoying gardening in my 50' geodesic greenhouse in the mountains of North Carolina, near Asheville at The Artful Dome Mountain Retreat.   I am in the process of creating my ultimate Guesthouse, The Artful Zen Mountain Retreat which will be open in the spring, 2023.  It is located a few miles outside of Asheville and will have 3 BR/2Bath, Garden room, Spa area, pond, stream, Food garden, a Zen Garden, and plenty of place for relaxation.  I am always seeking the high road and enjoy inspiring people and sharing my vision for our emerging paradigm shift.  My life is built on the foundations of love, gratitude, compassion and generosity.  I am thankful to have so many guests that love staying in my guesthouses!",

Like a 5-star hotel on wheels!\n\nThe camper was very comfortable, the grounds are beautiful, & the biodome is just extraordinary. . .so very unique & special!   We roasted marshmallows & made s'mores while we listened to John Denver songs.  Perfectly nostalgic.\n\nWaynesville is close by & charming with a great variety of restaurants.  Our favorite was Birchwood Hill. . .try the duck!\n\nIt didn't take long to get up to The Blueridge Parkway.  We were fortunate to have perfect weather for hiking & sightseeing.\n\nEven after we checked out, Nina continued to be kind & helpful.  There should be a rating above Super Host for her!",

    "summary": "Modern RV (Glamper) with 2 queen beds (one soft, one firm), a Smart TV, WIFI, full kitchen, BBQ Grill, outdoor patio with lounge chairs for sunbathing, star gazing, outside grilling and dining. My art studio is located in the biodome to the side. Space for yoga or meditation or enjoy playing your instruments or just hanging out while soaking in the energy of this magnificent crystal centered structure.  Next to the fire pit we have  gurgling stream.",
    "space": "The Land:  So much more to offer than initially meets the eye, this land sits on a bedrock of quartz crystal and vortex/ley line, according to native american folklore and dowsing.  We are at about 3000 feet in elevation so it does get cool at night.  We suggest turning off the AC and opening all the windows for a nice cool breeze all night.  Ahhhh, mountain air!\n\nThe Space:  This 34' Reverse Loft RV has two comfortable queen beds.  The firm bed is upstairs and overhead from the reverse loft downstairs which has a memory foam mattress.  The TV/DVD is in the living area and we subscribe to Netflix which you connect to via the Smart DVD player.  \n\nThe Adjacent Porch, Patio and Biodome:  Aside from a very comfortable place to eat, sleep and be merry, this “tiny house” sits next to a \"small copy\" of Buckminster Fuller’s geodesic dome design, modeled after the 1967 US Pavillion at the Montreal World Expo and built by John Denver’s crew in 1987, right after they finished building singer/songrwriter Denver’s biodome at the Windstar Foundation in Snowmass, Colorado.  Our Biodome is 50' in diameter and 3 stories high!  The Biodome has a deep history as the centerpiece for an early biodynamic farming community.  Your host, Nina Howard,  has converted the Biodome into a modern art studio to paint her large abstracts as well as to protect and house her plants during the colder months so that she can have year round organic veggies and flowers.  Nina asks that you respect the privacy of her art studio and do not enter into it unless she is there (no doors).  The art studio only takes up about 1/3 of the space inside the dome.  The rest can be enjoyed by her guests!  Nina is only there 2 or 3 days a week (usually during the week) for a couple hours each day and you probably won't even see her.  \n\nPatio:  Two loungers on the patio are great for south facing sunbathing or moon gazing at night.  \n\nPorch:  The porch has a dining table and settee and chairs, including a big rocking chair,  for just hanging out.\n\nThe Grape vineyard and fruit orchard:  Follow the paved road in front up the hill and to your left you will see the grape vineyard, blackberry patch and fruit orchard.  In late summer the fruits are in season.  Help yourself!!  Also, find a nice spot behind the vineyard to perch and enjoy the rolling mountain views!\n\nFood:  We offer coffee, tea, oatmeal, and crunchy breakfast bars for your first morning so that if you get in late you won't have to go grocery shopping before breakfast.",
    "access": "Park behind the RV (go along the gravel road) and turn right just behind the RV.\nIt is best to enter the Biodome Village from the upper or second Biodome Drive entrance and come down the hill.",
    "notes": "Entry and key instructions will be sent in your Welcome Letter. \n\nA small non-shedding dog will be considered with a $25 pet fee.",
    "neighborhood": "This neighborhood (The Biodome Village) was built as a Biodynamic Farming Community in the mid 80's that included 8 homes and a large barn right next door (which is now a mixed use residence/business).  Other houses in the Biodome Village are private residences.  The residents no longer do cooperative gardening and live individual and private lives.  Your host has retained the grape vineyard  on a separate lot across the street and up the hill which includes blackberries and fruit trees.  When fruit is in season, help yourself!  The views are awesome from the vineyard!",
    "transit": "Lake Junaluska has a walking trail around it which takes about an hour.  Beauty abounds!  It is about 6 miles away towards Waynesville.  You can also kayak on the lake.  There is so much to do in and around Waynesville, Maggie Valley, Cherokee, the national park, waterfalls, hiking trails, etc.",
    "interaction": "Nina Howard lives twenty miles away and will be available to support your stay.",
    "house_rules": "Quiet hours after 10 pm (County rule)\nPlease remove shoes when entering the RV.  There is a shelf to the right of the door to place them.\nNo smoking inside the RV or Biodome (outside only).\nPlease park behind the RV.  There is a space available next to an aluminum trailer.  Please do not park out front and block the roadway.  If you have two cars, you can park the second car on the pavement in front of the biodome.\nIf I am working in my art studio next door, please feel free to come over and interact.  I love sharing my \"craft\"!\nIf you use the firepit, please replace the wood.  All the gas stations around sell wood bundles.  Thank you.\nIf you open the awning, you must close it if you leave.  Wind gusts will rip them off in a snap!\nPlease take your trash and place it in the metal trash cans along the driveway behind the RV.  We have a recycle can and a trash can.  \nOnly small non shedding lap dogs are allowed.  We will send a request for $25 pet fee upon arrival with pet rules. \nPlease ask children not to stand or walk across the waterfalls. It takes a great deal of time to get them to \"fall\" and any movement can knock them over.",

We bought the farm to spend more time together outdoors but as the girls have gotten older and busier, we aren’t able to go as often. The farm once had pigs, cows, and goats along with the horses and donkeys. We still love visiting the farm but are more excited now to share it with you. We also have a couple Airbnb’s in Cleveland TN as well as one in Ooltewah TN. We love hosting and hope that you enjoy your stay whichever place you may be! ",

We really enjoyed connecting with each other in such a quiet, private, and beautiful place.",

    "summary": "The Golden Star Dome brings glamping to a whole new level.  Enjoy the expansive deck overlooking the pond and the lavender field while catching a glimpse of the colorful sunset.  Get wrapped up in the king size bed while enjoying Netflix or your favorite streaming station or just looking out at the beautiful view.  The dome is centrally located between the Ocoee and Hiawassee rivers and is only a 15 minute drive to Benton falls and other points of interests.  A great getaway for memory making.",
    "space": "The dome is a great place to relax and unwind after a long day on the ocoee river or hiking the many trail heads that are within 15 minutes of the dome.  It is also a great place to just stay in and do nothing but relax in solitude or cuddle up with a loved one.  Internet is available but can be unreliable at times do to the farm extender system that it is on.  The Dome is well equipped for cooking as well as grilling and pizza making.  The brand new cooling and heating unit will keep you comfortable or cozy depending on the season you are here.  \nThe Dome is located on Shabo Farm in Benton TN.  You can enjoy the farm animals (2 horses and 2 donkeys) as well as 30 plus acres to explore.  The pond is under construction at the moment but will soon be stocked for fishing.  The lavender field is dormant in the months of Aug-early June and then starts to bloom  mid June and early July.  The Farm is expanding with other points of interests coming soon!",
    "access": "The property is open to explore.  BEWARE There is an electric fence that is active between the lavender and the horse field.",
    "notes": "Wifi is available but may be unreliable due to the farm expander system that it is on.  It is un-likely but there may be someone mowing the field while you are there but should only take 30 mins to an hour.  We try to warn our guests ahead of time if this happens.",
    "transit": "There is a parking space to the right of the dome.",
    "interaction": "This is a working a farm and improvements are being made on a steady basis.  You may see tractors in the field or someone working at the barn on occasion.  There is a farmhouse airbnb on the far side of the property that may or may not be occupied.  We do not live on the property but are only 40 minutes away if we are needed.",

We relaxed by the pool, went for a swim, took a stroll on the nice trail at the conservation area, had a fire, spent some time in the hammock, and fell asleep under the stars. The bed was so comfortable that we didn’t want to get up! The nicest part about the experience was that Daya and Dave had stocked the kitchen and mini fridge with things to cook for breakfast! Such a lovely touch! The hosts were also very friendly and had great communication throughout our visit. Daya and Dave really thought of everything with this rental! If we come back, we want to stay two nights next time! Thank you! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",

The dome itself was clean, cozy, and a fun and unique place to stay. Scott was extra thoughtful, going as far as to get me a brand new heated blanket since it was below freezing for the first time that season, and kind of unexpectedly. I would absolutely stay here or in another one of his stays again.",

Be aware it leans slightly more toward \"primitive\" than \"luxury\"; somewhere between a big fancy tent and an RV (\"Elizabeth\" has obviously never slept in either!!) but photos and descriptions are 100% accurate... it's tidy, inviting, and comfortable.  It still has heat, AC, a fridge, a bathroom,  a warm comfortable bed, and frankly the shower house was even nicer than expected - clean and surprisingly roomy!  We like to tent camp at primitive sites so the simplicity was perfect for us and for a brief stay... We were in town for just one night attending GO FEST in Roanoke but we could have easily stayed multiple nights.  The property felt safe; not far from the main road but still plenty private.  It's close enough to a small town for supplies but far enough from the city to experience an INCREDIBLE night sky and only the sounds of nature.  I would 100% stay here again.",

A tranquil oasis, it is less than three miles from downtown Floyd where you can enjoy live music, great food, eclectic shopping, and lots of outdoor adventure along the Blue Ridge Parkway. When you’ve had your fill of the hustle and bustle of a town with one stoplight, you can escape to your inviting and cozy dome, under the big sky, surrounded by nature. There is a mowed path along the perimeter of the farm and a 10’x10’ covered platform at the highest point, with a spectacular view. Hammocks are available there for your use! The pasture on the other side of the fence has cows who may serenade you occasionally.",
    "access": "“Bucky” is perched on a sturdy raised platform, three steps up from the ground. The door to the dome is a zippered flap, and when entering you will need to duck a little. Once inside, the dome is an open space, 8’6” floor to ceiling.",
    "notes": "*There is no lock on the dome door. If you are concerned, please lock valuables in in your car.\n*Please remove shoes at the door. \n*We have a dog that lives on the property. Her name is Stella, and she is gentle and friendly.\n *Weather can be unpredictable. There is a space heater and an electric blanket for heat. \n*Any vehicle can easily access sites.\n*The toilet is a clean and nice port-o-let, sink included. It is NOT shared with the other listing. \n*The shower house is shared with one other listing, “Daisy” the camper, which may or may not be rented when you are there. Please note- when temperatures are below freezing shower will not be operable.",

It was my daily-driver for a while but eventually decided my Matt Foley days were over and I retired the van in exchange for something more eco-friendly (but much less fun).  The van sat around in between weekend camping trips that unfortunately became less and less frequent as time passed. \n\nA year ago I decided that the holy grail of swaggin’ wagons could no longer be kept a secret from humanity. You really think I would hide something as great as this van under a bushel?? The answer is NO!!\n\nAnyway... So then I decided to build a campsite in my backyard so that others could enjoy the van the same way I have. \n\nWell now, I have purchased some land and have begun to draft the dream spots.  First, I started with a dome... reminds me of a hobbit home, but cooler!  I am now remodeling a bus and hope to have that to you soon!\n\nThanks for reading. ",

    "summary": "We considered calling this house “The View With Some Rooms,” but settled on The Lodge. One of a few units on the property, this private 3-bedroom house includes a rooftop dome (which serves as the third bedroom). From almost every spot, enjoy the jaw-dropping scenery of endless mountains, three states, and the Potomac River.\n\nWe have two other rentals on the property if you're looking to add more guests--the Cedar + the Cabin! Contact us for a full camp rental (sleeps up to 14).",
    "space": "The Lodge is a two bedroom, two full-bathroom unit with a fully stocked kitchen, cozy enclosed sunroom, adjoining game room, and two private outdoor patio areas. In the warmer months (March-ish ~ October-ish), one more bedroom opens up... on the ROOF! Sleep under the stars and take in the sunsets in our super cool rooftop dome--the Moonlight. \n\nWe provide almost everything you need including high-quality linens, luxury bath towels/hand towels/washcloths, extra hot tub towels, paper towels, toilet paper, basic spices/sugar/olive oil, fully stocked kitchen, all-natural shampoo/conditioner/body wash, natural hand soap, dish soap/detergent, etc. (we will email a full list upon booking).\n\nWe have two twin air mattresses available with all linens/pillows/blankets.\n\nThe Moonlight Dome (king bed) is located just outside the Lodge, and up a flight of stairs. Kick back and relax on the private rooftop deck, and use the telescope to stargaze. The dome is air conditioned (with blackout curtains!) during the warmer months. For the colder days, there is a small heater, but the (non-insulated) dome can still be quite chilly. The bed has a heated mattress pad, but there is always the option of two air mattresses/sheets indoors ;)  Please note that the dome shares the second full bathroom inside the Lodge.\n\nUpon arrival, you'll find a bag of fresh coffee beans and a s'mores kit waiting for you. Play some foosball, Pacman, or board games in the game room...tune into the Sonos speakers throughout the house...throw on a record...draw on the chalkboard wall...relax on the outdoor sofa while grilling up dinner (Weber grill)...watch a movie on the smart TVs (we provide Amazon Prime and Netflix to make it easy for you!)...throw some logs in the Solo stove fire pit (we stock you with fire starters and dry firewood!)...and cap off the night in the private hot tub under the stars. \n\nDirectly across the driveway from the Lodge is our outdoor Lounge area (chairs, cornhole, communal fire pit), which is shared with all guests staying on the property.  In the lower level of the Lodge is our newest guest amenity--the Trading Post. Pick up some CPP gear, drinks/snacks, or some items you might have forgotten to pack! There is also a mini library of books and records, and a postcard mailing station. This space is open for all guests staying on the property 24/7. Rest assured that while the Trading Post is located in the \"basement\" of the Lodge, there is no access from inside this space into the main living area. Once booked, we'll email you our custom Field Guide--highlighting all of our favorite recommendations for what to do, see, eat, and explore in the area. \n\nThe property has reliable, fast wifi, smart TVs, and good cell phone coverage.\n\nCamp Potomac Peak is located on a ridge of Cacapon Mountain and offers stellar views over the Potomac River into Maryland and Pennsylvania. Situated on 8 acres, the property offers plenty of room for stretching your legs and walking around the grounds. We are just 10 minutes from the spa town of Berkeley Springs, two fantastic state parks, and two amazing rivers.",
    "access": "Please note, the Lodge shares a driveway with our other rentals—the Cabin and the Cedar. The Cedar, in particular, is located a few yards away from the Lodge, but efforts have been made to include privacy for both. Because we have multiple units within close proximity to each other on the property, we ask that guests respect quiet hours after 10pm. Some of the grounds, and the Lounge area (with the killer view!) located across from the Lodge are shared, common spaces with other guests.",
    "notes": "We are meticulous about cleaning, and can ensure that the place will be spotless. The towels and sheets aren’t the only things fresh—as we wash all throw blankets and duvet covers before every guest.\n\nWe also live just five minutes away from Camp Potomac Peak, so if anything comes up where you might need assistance with something, we are almost always the ones you will interface with. Jeff is incredibly handy and can fix/solve most anything (but don't tell him I admitted that). We are both personally involved in ALL of the day-to-day operations at CPP, and we are available 24/7 (we provide our personal cell phone #'s upon arrival).",
    "neighborhood": "Once booked, we will email our custom Field Guide to help you navigate around all our favorite spots in the area. In a nutshell, a 10 minute drive brings you to the historic downtown of Berkeley Springs (shops, antiques, farmers market, brewery, historic movie theater, great restaurants) and in 20 minutes, you're at the fantastic Cacapon State Park (lake beach, hiking, 18-hole golf course, mountain biking, horseback riding, tennis).",
    "transit": "There is a shared driveway that connects all the units at Camp Potomac Peak— the Lodge, the Cabin, and the Cedar. There is room for TWO cars right next to the Lodge. Because this part of the driveway is shared with the Cedar, parking locations are very important. We will send specific instructions prior to your stay. If more than two cars need to park, we have a large gravel lot at the bottom of the driveway!",
    "interaction": "We will be available 24 hours a day for any questions during your stay, and live just five minutes down the road.",

    "summary": "Reconnect with nature without roughing it, at Moonhaven Haus, an unforgettable glamping escape in the SC Upstate. Our luxury Moroccan-inspired geodesic dome has a full kitchen, enclosed bath, ultra-comfy bed and living area with forest and mountain views, and fast WiFi! Just 12 min. into Travelers Rest, 30 min. to Greenville or Hendersonville, and 45 min. to Asheville. Explore our area, then return to your private oasis with intriguing design details and an abundance of amenities inside and out!",
    "space": "Imagine yourself securely perched just high enough in the forest (four steps up), inside your cozy but spacious climate-controlled dome. Glamping-Plus, we call it. At a roomy 525 sq. ft., Moonhaven Haus is a design-forward space ideal for couples or solo travelers (no children under 13, or pets, please). You'll love waking to the beauty of nature while experiencing the comforts and amenities of home; we've proactively considered the needs and wants of our guests, who are looking for a memorable experience outside of the ordinary. We cater to those with eclectic but discriminating tastes, who would enjoy sipping Moroccan mint tea while listening to our little vinyl collection and perusing the curated stash of books. Who'd relax in the cloud-like bed while streaming a movie from the Seventies, with swirling strobe lights dancing all around the dome's interior. Who love hiking and exploring cute towns but won't settle for a stay that isn't visually-striking and appealing to the senses. If that sounds like you, come settle in to Moonhaven Haus. The only problem? You just might not want to leave...\n\nHere are some more reasons why:\n*super-fast WiFi\n*lots of entertainment options, both analog and digital\n*entirely-unique interior design and curation\n*intriguing vintage decor items throughout the space\n*tons of lighting choices, including our gorgeous Turkish chandelier\n*high-end details such as Stagg water kettle and Solo fire pit\n*granite countertop with plenty of space and supplies for cooking\n*posh extras such as water filter pitcher, slippers, eye masks, and robes\n*bed made from locally-sourced walnut\n*full-length curtains so you don't feel exposed after dark\n*upholstered swivel chairs to take full advantage of the views (or watch TV)\n*custom wood and resin bathroom countertop, with lighting beneath\n*luxe shower with skylight and high-end natural Bathing Culture toiletries\n*custom-designed deck (there's nothing else like it!)\n*comfy deck seating with beautiful mountain and valley views\n*plenty of wood and charcoal for the Weber grill and Solo fire pit\n*options for add-on packages, such as love locks to hang from our fence, regular and premium steak dinners, special celebration extras, and the possibility of private yoga and massage sessions",
    "access": "You'll have private access to the dome site, which includes the dome (with full curtains for privacy and added insulation) and deck, plus a small amount of surrounding wooded area, with a Solo fire pit and chairs, grilling area, and a swing and meditation spot with a soothing wind chime (you can also hang our hammock if you'd like). It's easy to walk around the area on the unpaved road and the paved road going down the mountain, where you will see few cars or people. Please note that you'll be 3 minutes from the nearest restaurant (Country House Cafe) and 12 minutes from the nearest grocery store, so you'll want to plan accordingly.",
    "notes": "The dome is fully insulated, so there are no worries about adequate heating or cooling via the mini split. There's also a cute electric stove for ambience and/or extra heat. The dome and surrounding area are treated, but since you're in a large dome in a forested area, so you might see a couple of bugs; we recommend that the door be kept closed to greatly minimize this possibility. There are blackout curtains for privacy, but light/heat will come through the skylight during the day (and you can gaze up at the moon at night!). The kitchen has all the basics (and more) except a regular oven and dishwasher. Coffee and a variety of teas are provided. The kitchen also includes a large electric skillet, and the microwave can also be used as an air fryer and convection oven. The incinerating toilet is extremely environmentally-friendly--very easy to use and incredibly clean; the bathroom is enclosed.",
    "neighborhood": "The property is in a rural forested community with easy access to Hwy 25, atop a small mountain. The road up is paved and not too steep. There's a handful of neighbors, including family members of ours, who look out for each other and the area. You may not see any of them, and they will not be on the dome property. You won't feel isolated but will still have plenty of privacy! Please note that you'll be 12 minutes from the closest grocery store and our lovely downtown Travelers Rest.",
    "transit": "You'll need a vehicle (no need for 4WD, but it's best not to be towing a trailer, due to a few curves on the way up the paved road). Using a ride share service might be possible, though we would not recommend asking the driver to come all the way up to the dome spot, especially after dark. The road up the mountain is paved; the turn onto our street is a gravel/dirt road, as is the private parking area next to the dome.",
    "interaction": "Diane usually responds within minutes to any messages, especially between the hours of 8 am and 11 pm. We prefer to communicate via the app and highly recommend you have it on your phone with notifications turned on (you will receive messaging only pertaining to your trips), but if you need to text, just let us know; we do need to know that you are receiving our messages. We're happy to answer any questions you have, before or after booking! Please check out our area Guidebook as well.",
    "house_rules": "Vaping is fine outside; smoking is allowed only at the table on the deck with provided ashtray (if cigarette butts are found on the ground outside the dome, an extra charge may be imposed--thank you for keeping our forest safe!). Please don't venture onto neighbors' property (marked but ask if you have questions). The two-person maximum is firm, except that we allow an infant who isn't yet crawling or walking. If you play music outdoors, please keep the volume low at all times, where it can be heard only in a small area next to you, as sound travels outside! You can play music quite loudly inside the dome!",

There was a beautiful pond with extra large fish and the views of the mountains from the hot tub and fire pit was stunning. \n\nI felt very safe as there was gate that could be secured at the start of the long driveway. Previous reviews mentioned the dip going from the gravel to the steep paved portion of the driveway. This was actually fixed during my stay as a load of gravel was placed and should make it easier for lower vehicles. Although, the steepness may still be difficult in the winter months, so be aware.\n\nThe rental company was very responsive and friendly when needed and check-in was a breeze. Wi-Fi was working as was the satellite TV.\n\n I truly enjoyed hiking at Grayson Highlands State Park in VA, only 25 minutes away, and the Old Store at Grassy Creek was adorable and right down the road. I recommend their local ice cream sandwiches.",

    "space": "Geodesic Dome on 40 acres with bubbling hot tub overlooking a pond this is the tranquil setting you have been looking for. Conveniently located near Shatley Springs Restaurant, River House, Helton Creek, Virginia & North Carolina State Parks.\n\n\n\n\nLong Description\n\n\"Unforgettable\"\n\nGrassy Creek, NC - Be prepared for a totally UNFORGETTABLE experience!! Set on 40+ acres among the rolling hills of Eastern Ashe County and close to Southwest Virginia, you will find this wonderfully handcrafted Buckminster Fuller design Geodesic 3/4 Dome. With over 300 square feet of windows, the home itself makes you feel like part of the surroundings. Solid cherry paneling, wormy chestnut cabinets, and wooden floors are just the beginning. An inside stairway leads to an enclosed observatory at the top of the dome; a perfectly romantic spot to view the stars above the canopy of trees. A deck surrounds half of the exterior of the dome and offers a nice sitting area for relaxing. Just out the kitchen door, a stone pathway leads to the patio, where swing, picnic table, and hot tub await!!  Be sure to take some time to stroll around the property. Unforgettable is a tree-growing plantation as well as a working Frasier Fir Christmas tree farm and wildlife preserve, so numerous trails meander through the wooded and open areas. From the highest peaks, you might even catch a glimpse of Grandfather Mountain if it's a clear day. If not, the panoramic views are well worth the walk, and you're sure to enjoy just sitting by the scenic pond area with a cup of coffee or a good book. If you wish to venture out, the property is in close proximity to several landmarks in the area. The North Fork of the New River and Gale Winston's famous River House Gourmet Restaurant are only a couple of miles away. The confluence of the North and South Forks of the New River is about 6 miles away. Shatley Springs Restaurant is 5.5 miles away, and the Mount Rogers National Recreation Area is about 15 miles away via Highway 16N and VA Highway 58. If you're in for a day trip, you'll find directions at the home to Chateau Morrisette (fine dining, deli and winery). Check it out at  . It is well worth the 1.5 hour drive north on the Blue Ridge Parkway, at Meadows of Dan, VA where you will also enjoy Mabry Mills. Pick up a Parkway Guide so you don't miss all the hidden treasures along the way!  If the man is coming to fish, this is definitely THE PLACE. You are only one mile from Helton Creek Trout Stream, which is visited by fishermen from all over. In addition, this air conditioned home provides a fully equipped kitchen, Satellite TV, VCR, AM/FM Radio with C/D player, Washer/Dryer, and charcoal grill. With 1.5 baths, 1 Queen, 1 Double and 1 Twin Bed, the home will accommodate 5 in the upstairs loft area. Towels and Linens are provided; the home is pet friendly.

I realy felt comfortable and  luxurious. The Rooftop igloo was an absolute delight it was sooo relaxing at night after if cooled down outside. Also I adore how all the food is in walking distance.  My best advice would be, if you are driving to the Air bnb is to come before the weekend so you can find a parking  spot and be there before 3pm so you can park close to your stay. The house smelled  soo good and fresh and each room had it's own ascetic that was really fun eaxh night we switched  room just to sleep in each decor. Only con was the oven wasn't  working when we got a pizza from the store.  (the store is in walking dostance as well ...16 mins to be exact) Other than that everything literally  EVERYTHING  in this home was devine and so peacful, you will definitely want to take pictures and stay a 2nd time !",

It was but, it's a city and she made sure it was no surprise. \nThe single change I would make is far beyond her control - I am just not used to being connected by walls to the neighbors. Again, it was a big city!\nWalking and exploring were simply out the door and we enjoyed our time immensely. Thank you Pia!",

Look out the windows at the forest, mountaintop and sky. Relax on the little porch, savor eating meals on the picnic table  and enjoy the warm propane fire pit. Lay down in the comfy queen sized bed and drift off to sleep while watching the beauty of the night sky!",
    "space": "Come visit this unique camping dome in the Smoky Mountains! See the night sky from your bed and enjoy being close to nature. This is a Glamping experience. Glamping is luxurious camping with more modern amenities like power, finished floors, beautiful views, and comfortable furnishings, but it is still camping. The domes are not insulated so it can get hot during the day in the summer and cold at night in the winter. There is an A/C and a heater in the unit, as well as a heated blanket, but similar to camping, expect the weather to be a factor.  Explore Tennessee by day and relax in your dome at night. The dome has a large bay window and several sky windows. You’ll find a barn with an apartment, a tiny house, and three other domes on the property. Inside the barn, we have indoor showers and bathrooms. There is also a mini fridge, microwave, and coffee maker available for all guests to use. Additionally, we have an outdoor shower, but it will be shut off during winter months. There is also a propane fireplace to enjoy s'mores or hotdogs at night and a picnic table to eat and prepare meals. \n\nPET POLICY: We are pet friendly and understand pets are part of the family. We gladly welcome our guests traveling with pets. There will be a $20 fee per stay for each pet. Pet's MAY NOT be left unattended in the dome or on the property. Guests are liable for any damages done by their animal during their stay.",
    "access": "Dome, porch, picnic table and propane fire pit are just for you. Park in the gravel driveway right near the dome. Shower and portable toilet are shared if there are guests in the the other dome and tiny house.",
    "notes": "The dome is not insulated so it can get hot during the day in the summer and cold at night in the winter. There is an A/C unit and a heater in the dome, as well as a heated blanket, but similar to camping, expect the weather to be a factor.\n\nVerizon is the only service provider that works here. We do provide Wi-fi on site, but it is spotty around the property, but can be used to check email or send imessages. If you are unable to access Wi-Fi at your dome, you can use the guest area in the passway of the barn to access a stronger WiFi signal. \n\nThere is no plumbing inside the domes. Bathrooms and showers are provided onsite and are shared with other guests.",
    "neighborhood": "Nestled in the Great Smoky Mountains, you’ll be in a quiet area where you can get away from it all. You’ll be 15 minutes from the Great Smoky Mountains National Park Cosby entrance. Just 30 minutes to Dollywood. It’s also a beautiful 25-30 minute scenic drive from Historic Gatlinburg, Pigeon Forge, Sevierville, and Newport. The property is across the street from a beautiful creek and you’ll have a mountain top in your back yard.",
    "transit": "Pull in front of the barn and park on the gravel, about 10 yards from your dome.",
    "interaction": "The dome is equipped with a keypad for self check-in. We’re also very accessible via the Airbnb app, call or text.",

The view of the lake and trees were beautiful. We loved watching the sunrise in the morning. The surrounding was quiet and peaceful. There's so much natural light in the dome, which is beautiful. The home was equipped with everything we needed. We cooked breakfast and dinner each day in the beautiful kitchen and used the speakers to listen to music. We also watched the women's World Cup throughout the weekend on the smart TV and sat by the fire pit. For activities in the area, we went downtown to explore shops, went to Mari vineyard, and went on Nauti Cat's sunset boat tour on the last night. Overall, we couldn't have stayed at a more perfect home than Kathryn's mini dome.",

The space is a perfect home away from home, and I highly recommend. We met the owners and they are so helpful and kind. Best yurt getaway!! 5 stars!",

    "summary": "ABOUT THE GEODESIC DOME",
    "space": "Our glamping dome is situated in the middle of the Getaway on Ranger Creek and is stunning. Be amazed as you walk into the 700+sqft, 30ft diameter dome, with a soaring 17 foot high ceiling in the center! Inside is climate-controlled (heat and A/C), with a full modern kitchen, a comfortable reading area (along with a selection of books and games), a large living area with a couch that converts to a bed, and a giant beanbag for relaxing in front of the enormous 8’ tall by 20’ wide window. The bathroom features a large tiled shower with a rain shower head. The bedroom is spacious, and includes a bed with a memory foam queen-sized mattress, ceiling fan, reading lights, and USB charging ports. There are 2 “smart” TVs (living area and bedroom) where you can log on to your streaming service to enjoy your favorite entertainment.  Outside is a patio area with a firepit, great places to sit and lounge, a grill and a picnic table to eat on. The dome’s giant window overlooks woods and meadow, as well as a ¾ acre pond, complete with ducks. \r\n\r\nThe Dome also features very good reception from our free high-speed guest Wifi (usually over 75Mbps). Additionally, Verizon and AT&T have good reception in and around the dome.\r\n\r\nABOUT THE GETAWAY ON RANGER CREEK\r\n\r\nDo you have a sense of adventure, a true ‘think out of the box’ kind of mindset? Do you like to try new and unusual things just because you can?\r\nThen the Getaway on Ranger Creek is the place for you!\r\n\r\nThe Getaway on Ranger Creek is a unique 18 acre property in the heart of the South Cumberland Mountains, close to the fabulous new Coalmont OHV Park, Fast Farms MotorX, Greeter Falls, Foster Falls, and many other parks and recreation areas.. \r\n\r\nWe have parking accommodations for truck and trailer, and a unique variety of units for you to stay and relax.\r\n\r\nThe property owners/managers live on-site. While they will be available for quick resolution of any of your needs or for any maintenance issues, they are not always physically on-site. They always strive to provide you with privacy and relaxation, so you’ll rarely see them, unless you need them!T\r\n\r\nOutside areas of our property are insecticide- and herbicide-free. However, our small flock of friendly Muscovy Ducks and a variety of chickens work very hard to keep the mosquito and tick levels to a minimum. You’ll be amazed at just how few mosquitoes you’ll encounter, especially considering that the property is in the Tennessee woods! Guests should note that our ducks and chickens are very friendly and may “hang out” in your general area if you are outside. They are completely harmless, and even enjoy eating your food leftovers if you offer them!\r\n\r\nWe offer so much for those who truly like to experience things outside the norm! Stay in one of our 4 unique glamping units, and explore our 18-acre wooded property, including several trails, a woodland pond, peaceful areas to sit and relax, 2 creeks which border the property, and a small stream. \r\n\r\nHave you ever spent the night in a geodesic dome that is overlooking a woodland pond? Watch the stars sparkling in an indigo night from the wraparound deck!\r\n\r\nHave you ever imagined yourself lounging in a stylish glamping tent tucked in the woods with a deer wandering by? Or maybe a stay in a crisp Scandinavian style cabin, nestled in the woods, with a large covered deck. And, coming soon, you’ll be able to spend a night in a “teardrop” style camper, with a huge covered deck for outdoor enjoyment. \r\n\r\nAll units offer privacy. The Dome overlooks our pond, and all other units are nestled in their own areas of the woods. The Dome is fully self-sufficient. All other units include electric, a fire pit, a propane grill, a small refrigerator, and a foot-pump sink with 5 gallons of fresh water (can be refilled upon request). \r\n\r\nFor guests staying in the glamping tent, cabin, or camper, we have a lovely bathhouse close by with two fully-appointed and private bathroom\\showers. Towels are provided for all guests.\r\n\r\nThe Getaway on Ranger Creek offers free high-speed guest Wifi (usually over 75Mbps) throughout most of the property. Additionally, Verizon and AT&T have very good reception in most areas. \r\n\r\nSo, if you like adventure, and being different from the crowd, what are you waiting for? Book one of these unique accommodations and then head out to explore the wonderful world of the South Cumberland Mountains.\r\n\r\nWe are just 20 to 30 minutes from outstanding trailheads throughout the rugged and majestic Savage Gulf State Park and the South Cumberland State Park. Waterfalls, towering sandstone cliffs, rock climbing, renowned hiking trails, kayaking, an incredible world of nature's bounty!\r\n\r\nDon’t miss a truly unique experience.\r\n\r\nPets and smoking/vaping are not allowed anywhere on the property, including within/around any of our glamping units, parking or public areas.",

The space was very beautiful and relaxing. They provided me firewood so I could make a fire. And I definitely splurged on the breakfast and coffee each morning. The only negative is there were a lot of ticks so come prepared.  Other than that, I really enjoyed disconnecting from the world and just relaxing with my dog in nature.",

It’s close to a lot of great, hiking trails and not far from the downtown strip as you’re looking to get something to eat rather than cook. Our only reservation was not the dome was close to the street. Although the street is not a major through fair, cars driving by at night did Leica. That house with a compostable toilet is very clean and comfort.",

    "summary": "The Dome is over 200 sqft (16 ft across) with an 8ft tall ceiling at the middle.  The Dome is equipped with a zipper door and has a canvas cover with windows and screens and features a large bay window that allows views of Little North Mountain and a full view of the farm.  There is a solar exhaust fan and wooden floors as well as a queen bed with linens and some causal seating. \n\nThere is no electricity or running water and no WIFI.  We do provide solar-powered and battery-powered lights. ",
    "space": "The Dome is located in a large grassy area with ample space near a creek.  You can pitch additional tents (not provided) near the dome for no additional cost. There is easy road access and on-site parking.  You are welcome to explore the farm along the mowed paths.  Please be aware that we do have cattle on the farm, so do not open any gates and stay clear of the fences as they may well be electrified.\n\nOutside, there is a fire pit and seating area as well as a grill and a dining area.  Some firewood is provided and there is additional firewood available for purchase on-site.  We also provide complimentary local beer or wine, as requested. \n\nLastly, we have a nice bathroom with a compost toilet but no running water and no shower. We are in the process of adding a full bathroom with shower near-by, but it will likely be 2024 before that project is finished.\n\nDisclaimer: If it has rained a lot in the past few days the area will be muddy, please plan accordingly!",
    "access": "The farm is over 200 acres of wooded mountain land and grassy pastures with some small creeks and springs.  Our goal is to create experiences, products, and a destination for folks to learn more about agriculture in the Valley and to instill a connection to the land.  This is our take on diversifying the  family farm and creating a modern agritourism destination.\n\nOur Farm currently has grass-fed beef cattle and unique lodging options, like the Dome. We also have a small garden and some hops.  \n\nWhen visiting Our Farm, please ask about how to purchase our farm-raised beef and vegetables for your dinner.",
    "notes": "Our Farm is within 20-30 minutes of Winchester, Woodstock, and Front Royal in Strasburg, VA. The northern Shenandoah Valley has a lot to offer.  There is a binder in the Dome with information on local attractions but please don't hesitate to ask us for more ideas!\n\nDue to weather and the holiday season the Dome will not be available for bookings from December 15th through March 15th.",
    "transit": "Getting around in this area definitely requires a vehicle. And for parking at the dome an SUV or truck is best but most vehicles can make it into the field.",
    "interaction": "We look forward to socializing with visitors over drinks during the evenings as they are interested.\n\nBreakfast is available as requested.  Requests must be received at least the night before by 7p.  We will deliver a basket of fresh baked goods to the Dome at a time decided upon by both parties.  We currently offer popovers, scones and muffins.  Donations are appreciated.",

The hot tub is a necessity after a long day exploring all the great things the Smokys have to offer, and the sleep is amazing listening to the ambient sounds of nature. If you’re lucky enough to experience rain while staying in the dome, it’s so magical falling asleep to. The hosts are kind and very accommodating, and put a lot into making this property everything you could ask for! Thank you for the beautiful stay! ⛰️",

It also rained on us the last night and that was an amazing thing to experience as you can definitely hear the beautiful rain yet peaceful enough to sleep through!",

The globe was incredibly cute and provided all the amenities I needed for a comfortable stay. I particularly loved the spacious interior and the fantastic hot tub that offered a relaxing retreat.\n\nWe were lucky enough to have two thunderstorms and it was amazing to watch it in the dome!\n\nAlthough the host mentioned that you may hear highway noise due to its location, it's worth noting that the nearby highway noise was louder than expected, especially during the day. Additionally, the water had a quirky smell but wasn’t a deal breaker for us.\n\nOverall, my stay at the Glamping Globe was delightful, with the only downsides being the highway noise and the water scent. If you're seeking a cozy and well-equipped glamping experience close to Gatlinburg's attractions, this place is worth considering.",

    "summary": "***Now Available For Booking ***\nStay on a 140 acre farm in the only camping dome shelter location in the Smoky Mountains and get back to nature! Look out the windows at the forest, mountaintop and sky. Relax on the little porch and enjoy the warm propane fire pit. Lay down in the comfy queen sized bed and drift off to sleep while watching the beauty of the night sky!",
    "space": "Come visit this unique camping dome in the Smoky Mountains! See the night sky from your bed and enjoy being close to nature. This is a Glamping experience. Glamping is luxurious camping with more modern amenities like power, finished floors, beautiful views, and comfortable furnishings, but it is still camping. The domes are not insulated so it can get hot during the day in the summer and cold at night in the winter. There is an A/C and a heater in the unit, as well as a heated blanket, but similar to camping, expect the weather to be a factor. Explore Tennessee by day and relax in your dome at night. The dome has a large bay window and several sky windows. You’ll find a barn with an apartment, a tiny house, and three other domes on the property. Inside the barn, we have indoor showers and bathrooms. There is also a mini fridge, microwave, and coffee maker available for all guests to use. Additionally we have an outdoor shower, but it will be shut off during winter months. There is also a propane fireplace to enjoy s'mores or hotdogs at night. A microwave, coffee maker, and small fridge are available in the passway of the barn for guests to use. \n\nPET POLICY: We are pet friendly and understand pets are part of the family. We gladly welcome our guests traveling with pets. There will be a $20 fee per stay for each pet. Pet's MAY NOT be left unattended in the dome or on the property. Guests are liable for any damages done by their animal during their stay.",
    "access": "Dome, porch and propane fire pit are just for you. Park in the gravel driveway right near the dome. Shower and portable toilet are shared if there are guests in the the other domes and tiny house.",
    "notes": "The dome is not insulated so it can get hot during the day in the summer and cold at night in the winter. There is an A/C unit and a heater in the dome, as well as a heated blanket, but similar to camping, expect the weather to be a factor.\n\nVerizon is the only service provider that works here. We do provide Wi-fi on site, but it is spotty around the property, but can be used to check email or send imessages. If you are unable to access Wi-Fi at your dome, you can use the guest area in the passway of the barn to access a stronger WiFi signal. \n\nThere is no plumbing inside the domes. Bathrooms and showers are provided onsite and are shared with other guests.",
    "neighborhood": "Nestled in the Great Smoky Mountains, you’ll be in a quiet area where you can get away from it all. You’ll be 15 minutes from the Great Smoky Mountains National Park Cosby entrance. Just 30 minutes to Dollywood. It’s also a beautiful 25-30 minute scenic drive from Historic Gatlinburg, Pigeon Forge, Sevierville, and Newport. The property is across the street from a beautiful creek and you’ll have a mountain top in your back yard.",

    "summary": "Glamp Blue Ridge is a one-of-a-kind glamping resort located in Cherry Log, GA. The property has 7 domes tucked away overlooking Fall Branch Falls and directly bordering the Chattahoochee National Forest and 300 mile long Benton MacKaye Hiking Trail. Each dome is 530 square feet, uniquely styled, and guarantees an unforgettable experience.",
    "space": "Dome Interior Details:\n\n-Bedroom (Sleeps 2 adults and 2 children):\n     -King size memory foam bed\n     -Corduroy bean bag than can easily be converted to a queen size bed (Great for kids)\n-Full kitchen equipped with fridge, freezer, ice maker, coffee maker (pods or drip), french press, microwave, dishwasher, 2 burner induction stovetop (compatible cookware provided), and all the tools needed to make a gourmet meal.\n-Custom shower, separate toilet room, and a vintage vanity for all your prepping needs\n-HVAC via a mini split system to offer year-round heating and air conditioning\n-Wireless internet provided by Starlink (plenty fast to stream movies and stay connected)\n-Privacy curtains for large clear front window\n-4 person dining table\n-Games and playing cards\n\nDome Exterior Details:\n\n-4 person hot tub with privacy walls\n-Large exterior deck space for relaxing\n     -Cafe lighting\n-Blackstone gas griddle (propane provided)\n-Tiki firepit\n-Comfortable seating for 4 via an outdoor sofa and chairs.\n\nGlampsite Details:\n\n-Fall Branch Falls! Each dome directly borders the falls and offers an amazing way to experience the falls and surrounding environment\n-Hiking - Glamp Blue Ridge directly borders the famous Benton MacKaye Trail.  Just cross over at the top of falls and you have access to over 300 miles of hiking!\n-2 community firepits\n-Treeweave Hammock - Oh man, this is so cool. You're just going to have to trust us here.\n-Landscape lighting - the entire property lights up at night to create a very special feel and the ease of getting around.\n\nDome 7 (Amelia) - Specific Details:\n\n-Named after the iconic Amelia Earhart and the dome's style takes after her affinity for aviation.  You'll notice a spacewoman lounging in floral wallpaper behind the king size bed, and the rest of the dome takes a fun playful vibe that will surely keep all our guests surprised and delighted throughout their stay.\n-Amelia's outdoor area includes a tree through the deck with an attached hammock and is our most private dome\n-Offers easy access as it is located very close to the designated parking area\n\nGeneral Details:\n\nWhile we have taken all efforts to provide the highest Glamping experience possible, there are still some elements of camping at Glamp Blue Ridge that we would like you to be aware of:\n\n-HVAC - the domes have an oversized HVAC system and do provide a comfortable interior temperature. But, in extremely cold or hot weather the systems will be unable to offer a crisp 72 degrees due to little insulation in the domes. Expect mid 70s in extremely hot weather and mid 60s in extremely cold weather.\n-Nature - the domes are treated monthly for pest control, but it is possible you will see an insect or two in the domes.\n-The Falls - Fall Branch Falls is a public waterfall accessible to the public via a hike. You will see hikers around the falls and on the public viewing platform at the bottom of the falls. We have signage designating Glamp Blue Ridge as private property, but it is still possible a hiker may cross the falls to get a closer look at Glamp Blue Ridge. We have met countless visitors over the 2-year process of building Glamp Blue Ridge and have never had an issue politely asking hikers to stay on the US National Forest side of the falls.\n-Dome Distances - Each dome is 30-50 feet from each other. We have oriented the domes so that the outside deck space still offers a good bit of privacy from the other domes.\n\nThe Area:\n\n-Glamp Blue Ridge borders the Aska adventure area. Offering hiking, mountain biking, fishing, and some of the most picturesque forests in the Blue Ridge area\n-20 minutes to downtown Blue Ridge or Ellijay offering high-end dining, breweries, shopping, drive-in movie theater and much more!\n-10 minutes from the Toccoa River with tubing, rafting, kayaking, fishing, gem-mining and more!\n-25 minutes from Lake Blue Ridge Marina where you can rent a boat and experience one of the prettiest lakes is Southeast.\n\nHigh-five if you read all this! Nice work",

My wife wanted to book a log cabin and so booking this instead was a bit risky!  But it paid off!  We loved sitting on the couch looking out through the huge window watching the creeks flow by and observing wild turkeys walk around outside the done.  Peaceful and beautiful!\n\nWe also had a few questions for our host and the response time was truly unbelievable!  We were shocked at how quickly and kindly our host replied to our questions.   We even asked about the bedspread because my wife liked it so much and Heidi sent us a link to the website where she bought it!

My wife wanted to book a log cabin and so booking this instead was a bit risky!  But it paid off!  We loved sitting on the couch looking out through the huge window watching the creeks flow by and observing wild turkeys walk around outside the done.  Peaceful and beautiful!\n\nWe also had a few questions for our host and the response time was truly unbelievable!  We were shocked at how quickly and kindly our host replied to our questions.   We even asked about the bedspread because my wife liked it so much and Heidi sent us a link to the website where she bought it!  Wow!\n\nOverall, for us, this was perfect. \n\nFor future guests, you should know that you are in the great outdoors so the sound of crickets and frogs are prevalent at night.

The location was convenient to exploring the area (the purpose of my visit) as it is right off the road, there was a little street noise but it isnt bothersome.  The stream and forest view are peaceful. The host was friendly and available!!",

It’s easy to find, Heidi is great at making it an easy process and the forest and creek views are stunning. My girlfriend was a bit scared and hesitant at the beginning, but by the end she felt safe and comfortable. There is a spa on the deck, a fire pit on the creek side and a plethora of amenities once you enter the dome. Cooking utensils, glass containers to store food, trash bags, cleaning supplies, shampoo/conditioner, Keurig, microwave, Ninja foodie, and much more. Overall a wonderful clean and very cute decorated little mountain forest oasis retreat.",

We went with the intention of being off grid, so know before you go, there is no WiFi and we have Verizon and there was no cell service for us for quite some time before arriving. I suggest screenshot or print directions, rules etc before coming.",

We also spotted a big family of wild hogs across the fence around sunset. No access to the internet/wifi only added to the experience - it was great to disconnect from the world and enjoy the time in the woods.",

You’re close enough to Traverse City, but yet far enough away to have a peaceful, private experience. My boys loved exploring the property thanks to Rob’s son. We can’t wait to come back next year!!",

We seek to provide you with a unique, intimate interaction with nature, yet you are only a few miles away from the best of Traverse City.",
    "neighborhood": "Near By Destinations\n\nThe Silver Birch Resort is located just a few miles from dozens of attractions.\n\nHorse Show – Traverse City Horse Shows is 3 miles away.  Shows run from June until September.  Check their website for show days and hours\n\nBeaches & Swimming – some of Traverse City’s finest beaches are only 5 miles away on East Bay (due west until you dead end into US31, turn left and immediately turn right.\n\nWine Tasting – Traverse City’s reputation for producing world-class wines is quickly growing as many of the wineries have been winning awards. Most of these wineries call Old Mission Peninsula home. Even if wine is not your on To Do list, the drive through the rolling hills of the peninsula will provide breathtaking views of East and West Bays. The mouth of the peninsula is approximately 10 miles from Silver Birch Resort. After sampling the wonderful wines, you might as well drive to the northernmost point of the peninsula and visit Mission Point Lighthouse.\n\nBreweries – Traverse City and the surrounding areas have a plethora of micro-breweries featuring locally grown hops. Some of our favorites include Shorts Brewery and Stone Hound Brewing Company. Please note: the owners believe in constantly checking the quality of all our local beers. We have never had a bad beer in any of the dozen downtown breweries.\n\nShorts Brewery – 211 Industrial Park Drive, Elk Rapids, MI 49629\nStone Hound Brewery – 3593 Bunker Hill Rd, Williamsburg, MI 49690\n\nShopping – downtown Traverse City with street after street of unique gift shops, clothing boutiques, restaurants, and bistros is only 11 miles away.\n\nElk Rapids – charming Elk Rapids is only 20 miles away. Would you like to see a real-life “Norman Rockwell” town? It doesn’t get any better than this. The beaches are some of the finest in northern Michigan, but sharing this secret will get us in trouble with many of the locals who refuse to tell visitors about Elk Rapids for not wanting to see it lose its “yesterday” charm. Please don’t tell anyone where you got this information. Elk Rapids also has an authentic single-screen movie theatre that was built in the early nineteenth century. You will feel like you are stepping back to a bygone era. The popcorn, root beer & cherry soda is some of the best you’ve ever had. If a movie is desired, be sure to bring cash as twenty-first-century plastic is not accepted. All employees are committed to keeping the old-fashioned movie experience authentic.\n\nRestaurants\n\nBoth Traverse City and Elk Rapids are considered “foodie” towns. Restaurants in our area that serve mediocre food do not last long. Just about every restaurant in this area has good quality food. Some of the owners’ favorites are:\n\nHopscotch Brick Oven & Taproom\n2032 US-31, Traverse City, MI 49686\n\nRed Ginger is located in downtown Traverse City. If you like calamari, you must try the appetizer.\n237 E Front St, Traverse City, MI 49684\n\nRed Mesa on US31 offers Mexican/Spanish dishes.\n1544 US-31 N, Traverse City, MI 49686\n\nPearls in Elk Rapids specializes in Louisiana Cajun cooking.\n617 Ames St, Elk Rapids, MI 49629\n\nMcGee’s in Acme. The closest restaurant and only four miles away.\n4341 M-72, Williamsburg, MI 49690\n\nJolly Pumpkin on Old Mission Peninsula.\n13512 Peninsula Dr, Traverse City, MI 49686\n\nDon's Drive Inn. 50's diner theme with great burgers and killer milkshakes.\n2030 US 31 N., Traverse City, MI 49686\n\nPizza Options\nEast Bay Pizza – In our opinion, the best pizza (partly because the owner’s brother operates it) is East Bay Pizza. Their pizza is outstanding and dining in will also give you one of the best views of the Bay. They also serve 30 flavors of Moomer’s Ice Cream. Moomers won the title of Best Ice Cream in America in a contest sponsored by Good Morning American. A perfect summer night in northern Michigan is defined by a good pizza, ice cream, and breathtaking sunsets on the Bay. East Bay Pizza has all three.\n4386 US-31, Traverse City, MI 49686\n\nThat’s A Pizza – want to eat in? That’s A Pizza will deliver right to your site. This was the owner’s favorite pizza place until his brother opened. They have excellent pizza and a great staff.\n5430 US-31, Williamsburg, MI 49690\n\nSleeping Bear Sand Dunes – named by Good Morning American as “The Most Beautiful Place in America”. People come from all over the world (no joke, Sleeping Bear sees tens of thousands of visitors from Europe and Japan who travel specifically to see the sand dunes. Expending a little energy and climbing the dunes affords you unbelievable views of Lake Michigan and surrounding lakes. You will quickly realize why Good Morning American bestowed this title. The Sleeping Bear Sand Dunes are approximately 36 miles away.\n\nCharlevoix, Michigan – another wonderful, charming town with great restaurants, shopping, and breathtaking views.\n\nGolfing – we are located near three of Michigan’s finest golf courses: The Bear, The Wolverine, and LochenHeath. Check out their websites for all the awards and reviews. These golf courses are only 4 miles away.\n\nThe Bear, The Wolverine, and LochenHeath\n\nTurtle Creek Casino –   If you enjoy the excitement of gambling and the nightlife, you will only be 1.5 miles away from the beautiful Turtle Creek Casino.  In addition to your favorite games, there is a fine restaurant and club with music and dancing.",
    "house_rules": "PET POLICY\n\nWe are dog lovers.  We have two of our own.  We did realize at the end of last year that we must put a pet policy in place. A guest last year left their dog all day in the dome, and it barked the entire time they were gone disrupting the experience of other guests.  This was a dog with a deep, loud bark.  The dog barked for eight hours straight which was impressive as you would think it would lose its voice after a few hours.  Everyone’s nerves were fried by the time the people returned. \n\nWe recently had a guest that asked if they could bring their dog. Even after reading this policy, they let their dog bark for almost an hour. It was not continuous, but it was 5 to 10 seconds of stressed-out, loud barking, and then silence. Every 5-10 minutes there was a barking outburst. I think they tied it up outside, and it wanted to come in the side. The dog was trying to get their attention.  I really did not want to have to walk down there and have a talk with them as we are trying for everyone to have a nice experience. I was very close to walking to their site, and then it stopped for the evening. The problem is the other five domes in the area. This had to disrupt their barbecues, campfires, and evening.\n \nEveryone knows their dogs.  Our two dogs would not bark if we left them somewhere unless they were startled.  This is understandable and acceptable.  If you have a dog that will bark from separation anxiety, we ask that he/she not be left alone (or outside alone while the family is indoors).  If you feel, the dog would only bark if startled, then we are fine with a dog.  If you are going to leave for a few hours, we ask that it be kenneled and left in the kitchen/bath structure – NOT left in the dome.  The kitchen/bath structure has more insulation, and the occasional bark will not travel through the entire property. \n\nThe other requirement we have for pets is that they are not allowed on the beds. We have already had to replace two comforters this year because we were not able to get the dog hair out. Please try and bring a dog bed.  If you cannot, we leave an extra sheet in the dresser drawer. This is specifically for your dog. You can lay this on the floor in an area and your pet is welcome to sleep on this. Dog hair on the comforter is subject to a $100 replacement fee.\n \nIf you agree to these pet policies, you are welcome to bring your dog.  \n\nWe are located on 75 acres and surrounded by thousands of acres of state forestry with trails. You can walk for miles and miles.  This is the perfect property to take your dog for a nice long walk.  If he or she will run after a deer, fox, raccoon, or porcupine, then we strongly suggest a lease as you are sure to see wildlife.",

The atmosphere was very relaxing and being inside the dome is very comfortable. There are a lot of mosquitos outside so make sure to bring bug repellent. Also, unfortunately the shower only had cold water but I was told hot water should be installed relatively soon. Overall, it was a nice, relaxing stay!",

    "summary": "Use this listing to reserve all 3 Dome Town Treehouses (Cloud, Puma and Turtle) at once.",
    "space": "Use this link to book all three domes at the same time for a private dome-experience up in the trees!  \n\nBy reserving all three domes (Cloud, Puma and Turtle), your group will have exclusive access to the bridges, lounging nets, canopy and Water Dome (where there are two full baths and a kitchen clean up area).  \n\nDome town is a series of geodesic domes suspended in the trees. The domes are connected by suspension bridges that weave through the canopy. In total there are three sleeping domes, a giant canopy lounge net, and one communal water dome, where there are two full baths, and one wash station. Sleeping in a dome will change the way you think about square building forever!  There is no other treehouse dome experience quite like this. Explore the canopy, enjoy the gorge, sleep in a dome!  ",
    "transit": "The domes are located up a single lane gravel county road. \n The water dome and other domes are connected by suspension bridges, walkways and stairs.  The outdoor lighting will be on until midnight and then we switch it off to allow the dark night forest sky to be just that--dark!  We recommend packing a flashlight or headlamp to aid in moving around after the lights are off.  ",

    "summary": "The ultimate glamping experience, staying in a large geodesic dome on a 200 acre horse farm.  \n\nThis unit has 2 king sized beds, one in the loft - accessed by stairs from the entryway, the other is a king Murphy bed which pulls out of the wall in the spacious living room - this dome can sleep 4 guests, or if it’s just 2 people they don’t need have another bed in their way!\n\nFull  kitchen designed with retro-chic appliances, separate dining room, and a full bathroom with a handmade cedar shower!",
    "neighborhood": "This is a quiet countryside community in a little valley of Oro-Medonte, where we value the peace and solitude of nature and want to share that with others. Glen Oro is 200 acres and backs onto \"Oro Mountain\" and a Simcoe County forest with even more public hiking trails which we encourage guests to use.",
    "transit": "It is dark out here at night, but at least it lets you see the stars!  There is no public transportation nearby so you will need to drive a vehicle to come and go from Glen Oro.  All speeds on property must be 20km/h or below and give way to horses.  Be aware that parking is outside of the forest, and we shuttle you via 4x4 \"Gator\" into your Glamping Accommodation so that we can preserve the trails and natural environment of the Eco-Retreat, from there it's two feet and a heartbeat!.  Sometimes the paths are muddy or snowy and they are definitely dirty so dress for the outdoors!",

It was private and serene and was so nice to disconnect for the day/evening. The soaking tub outside was my favorite. Megan was very responsive and so easy to communicate with. She even got us in a few hours early so we didn’t have to haul our stuff up to the dome in the pending rain. We’re already talking about our next trip and cannot wait to stay again!",

Sinon très tranquille et relaxant! Nous avons eu des réponses rapides à nos questions et le dôme (omis la toilette chimique) était très propre.",

We stayed in one of the luxury domes and I can say it was a 10/10 experience. It’s the attention to detail that really stood out to us. All the little things that bring you closer as a couple. The staff was amazing! Thomas and his hospitality was on point, he went above and beyond to make our experience even better. Also recommend ATV riding with Doug! It’s close by, fun, and you learn history of the town. My wife and are very close, it’s been almost eight years and I can say this brought us even closer! Don’t miss out on this and say “maybe one day.” Book the trip.",

My boyfriend loved the sauna and i loved the hot tub. Both of us had an amazing time and we had a great sleep. This is a great place to unwind from the city life and reconnect with the nature. \n\nSecond, the host. Lorne and family was an amazing hosts. Always there to help us whenever we need something. The communication with them was very easy. Lorne took his time to show us the place which we really appreciate. They gave us good suggestions on things to do, places to eat and to visit. \n\nWe will definitely come back. \n\n- Aaron and Jeraldin",

We were so fortunate that we got a chance for \"Stargazing\" as both the nights had very clear sky and comfortable temperature during our stay. This place was that much engaging that we didn't even go to Algonquin park trails even if we had a reservation for that. Thank you so much, Lorne and family, for  everything you did for us.

Southern hospitality never left us thirsty or at odds with a serene and beautifully landscaped backdrop. With community and friends welcome our stay has been top notch and exceeded our expectations! 20,000 out of 10!! Thank you",

I felt like family visiting with cousin George, his wife and mother-in-law. Ed volunteers help maintaining the mil's family cemetary and hosts a 5star meal too! There's a few topless mermaids and if dog allergies or sobriety are issues this is not your place. This felt like a vacation of lifetime in an architectural wonder, built by an Amish man for his family. The remote woods are so beautiful. I'm thankful for being able to sleep 8hours through 2 of my 4 nights there, I generally can't. I missed getting to meet Vicki, who was in Hawaii, hearsay she's kind and friendly. If there was a yearly rate & they would have me I'd love to make this my retirement home.  A bargin with utilities, maintenance, a cook and cleaning person! Lee, a gentle, loving, beautiful long haired malinois with soulful eyes stole my heart. Thanks Ed, your top notch.",

It was within a short drive of Dundas for really great food and we biked to Tew's falls and Christie lake along quiet back roads. Alexandra was responsive and friendly and helpful.

    "summary": "Less than an hour from Toronto and 5 minutes from the beautiful historic town of Dundas! Our Country Dome Home is a unique glamping overnight stay. The dome is located on a private property in a field behind our home. You will have access to the Dome with it's back deck, a half basketball court to play on and a parking space for your vehicle. The Dome is located within walking distance to the famous Webster's Falls (if you want a longer hike!) and a cute farm market/bakery!",
    "space": "The dome offers stunning sunset views, and an opportunity to fall asleep with nature – you will often hear the local wildlife and if you are lucky, wake up to deer in front of your window. Plenty of open space and natural light, it makes for a wonderful glamping experience.\n\nThe dome has a back deck with an outdoor BBQ and patio set. Inside there is a mini fridge and stove top oven. There is a lovely indoor fireplace, if you have a chilly evening it makes for romantic ambiance.\n\nThe oversized window creates beautiful views of the rolling hills and trees, a great place to relax or read a book.\n\nThe bathroom and kitchen both have hand wash trickle sinks that are gravity fed through a water bag in the dome storage loft and the bathroom has a compostable toilet [however no shower - this is why we only book 1 or 2 night stays]. Drinking water will be provided in the kitchenette for your stay and upon booking we offer food packages to stock your fridge for you if that is of interest – we utilize the wonderful market down the road which has gourmet meats and other treats (or you can go for a shop yourself as it is a very nice experience).\n\nThe dome features a queen-size bed with sheets, blankets, and two pillows.",
    "access": "Guests can access the dome and it's deck, the sand volleyball court, and the half basketball court. The trampoline however is off limits.",
    "notes": "• Guests must be comfortable with dogs as there is a sweet dog living on the property. Unfortunately, this means NO DOGS ALLOWED in the dome. \n\n• This is a camping experience, so although the dome comes equipped with a fan and a AC/heating unit, it is a large tent like space and therefore will not be temperature controlled like a home would be (but will be more comfortable than a tent on it’s own).\n\nYou may experience some bugs or animals, and coyotes can often be heard in the middle of the night.\n\nTHIS DOME DOES NOT HAVE A SHOWER. Please note that there are sinks for handwashing and an indoor bathroom (compostable toilet) but for this reason, we do not rent out the space for more than 2 nights. \n\n• Guests are responsible for their own safety and are expected to have basic camping skills. Guests should feel comfortable operating a wood-burning stove if they choose to use it.\n\nTrampoline is off limits please, but basketball court and volleyball court are free to use!",

It can happen but this will greatly minimize this.\n\n• Please be aware that reckless behaviour or damage to the property will not be tolerated. This will result in being escorted out of the property immediately with no refund.",

We stayed here for Monster Jam show in Allentown and my kid was more happy about the place than his Monster Truck show. \nRecommendation: Let guest know to bring Ryobi batteries if they can, there are enough batteries to last for couple days though. \nThe bottom of the tarp could be Velcroed  to the wooden frame to keep bugs and Snakes (we didn’t see any but could be a oossibility) out.\nThis property was a very unique experience for my family. \nAgain, thank you Joe and Nicole.",

Don't mind seeing bugs, insects, wild life or hearing any noises related to nature.  Be OK without HVAC. Are a camper but looking for more than a campsite.  Have never camped but want to give it a try.",

I would put my phone number in here but it is not allowed from Airbnb. If you have an emergency, please send questions before 8pm.  If you cannot reach me and it is an emergency please call 911.  \n\n*Guest/Tenant shall fully indemnify, hold harmless, and defend Host/1886 River Road and property owners and its agents from and against all claims, demands, actions, suits, damages, liabilities, losses, settlements, judgements, cost and expenses.

If you use anything, please put it back and do not leave it outside.\n\nIf a battery or item is not functioning, we may at our discretion, request replacement costs using whatever prices are on Ryobi website/ home depot.\n\nEARLY CHECK-INS are not guaranteed. Airbnb allows you to choose a preferred check in time, but it is ultimately up to the host to approve any check-ins before 4pm. An accepted request to book does not mean your early check-in time was approved. You will need to send us a message asking us if you can check in early.\n\nLATE CHECKOUTS must be approved by the management team. If you stay past your 11am check out time without approval, you will automatically be charged for the next nights’ stay at the listing’s full price.\n\nPACKAGES We do not allow guests to order mail/packages to this location for privacy reasons. If you attempt to have something delivered to this address, it will be rejected by the leasing office and we are not held responsible for its whereabouts.  \n\nMAINTENANCE Understand that we are at the mercy of the property management maintenance team for most general “fix-it” requests. We ask that all our guests are patient and understanding in regards to this. If a previous guest has damaged something minor and we were unable to fix it before check in, it will be reported to the complex staff, but it is dependent on the maintenance team’s schedule. Examples: blinds, curtains, and lightbulbs fall under the “non-emergency” maintenance category and won’t be completed until they’ve addressed any emergency requests around the property first.\n\nCLEANING Our cleaning fee is based on a courteous guest (e.g. someone who cleans up after themselves, puts dishes in the dishwasher, towels in the washer, leaves the place as they found it, etc.). This is NOT a hotel. If the housekeeping crew discovers an unreasonable mess post-checkout, we will charge an additional fee of $100.\n\nHOLD HARMLESS AGREEMENT:\n\n1/HOLD HARMLESS\n\nThe hosts and owners of the property do not assume any liability for any loss, damage or injury to persons or their personal property. Neither does the owner accept any liability for any perceived negligence or for any inconveniences, damage, loss or injury arising from any temporary defects or stoppage in supply of water, gas, cable, WiFi, electricity or plumbing due to weather conditions, natural disasters, acts of god, or other reasons beyond its control.\n\n2/ENTRY BY OWNER\n\nOwners or their designees may enter the premises under the following circumstances: In case of an emergency, to make any necessary agreed upon repairs, alterations or improvements, and to supply necessary or agreed upon services.\nLandscaping services are apart of regular exterior maintenance of the property, this work may occur without announcement from 10:00 - 5:00 pm 7 days a week.\n\n3/SLEEPING CAPACITY/DISTURBANCES\n\nGuest and all occupants will be required to vacate the premise and forfeit the payment fee and security deposit for any of the following: Occupancy exceeding the agreed upon guest count and names thereto, or occupancy exceeding the contracted guest count in the reservation, using the premises for any illegal activity, causing damage to the premises or any neighboring properties and any other acts that may interfere with neighbors rights to quiet enjoyments of their properties.\n\n4/MAINTENANCE\n\nPlease report any maintenance needs discovered on the premises and the host will respond as quickly as possible.\nRefunds will not be made for maintenance issues including, but not limited to electrical service interruptions, heating and air conditioning, appliances, televisions, cable, WiFi, and stereos.\n\n5/GUEST COUNT AND NAMES\n\nAs per booking platform rules names of all guests using the property must be listed on the reservation with the host. Any revisions to this list must be shared with the host prior to entering the property. Falsifying this information will result in termination of reservation without refund. Additional guests are not insured by Airbnb even if they stop by for a moment, everyone is better off being protected , we appreciate this respect in advance. All children of any age must be listed on the reservation without exception.\n\n6/GUESTS of GUESTS\n\nNo guest may invite any guest to the property that is not listed and named on the booking thought the booking platform. Any changes to the original guest list must be agreed upon with the host though an altered reservation before any new guest is allowed to enter the property. If the guest list is amended on the day of check in a call to the booking agent may be necessary but in all cases no new guest is allowed to enter the property without being listed on the reservation altered or otherwise.\n\n7/ GUEST CONTRACTORS\n\nIf a guest contracts any services during the reservation the host must be notified in advance. The contractor must be approved by the host who will require any such contractor to provide a valid insurance policy naming the property owners as beneficiaries of the policy.\n\n8/ OTHER ITEMS OF NOTE\n\nIf hiking in the woods be careful not to touch poison Ivy. It is a vine that grows up trees and around shrubs, 3 leaves and shiny. Also, check for ticks. We are in the North East of the United States and they are in the woods. Not so much near the house or lawn:) If you are planning on hanging outside all day or night I recommend bringing bug/mosquito repellant. Just a precaution. Tick season is April to October for our region.\n\nPlease leave all blankets and indoor items inside, this will reduce the amount of bugs tracked into the dome.\n\nAll food items left in the dome or over night while sleeping could potentially attract animals. Ideally, keep all food that you may have overnight outdoors in a cooler, etc. This is recommended for camp sites.\n\nAs this dome is essentially a large tent that is not a sealed structure, there may be bugs, spiders, flies, wasps, etc. We can't guarantee no bugs or pests in this camp-like experience.\n\nBy booking this unit, you have read, understood, and agreed to all these house rules.\n\nAs of mid 2022 Airbnb started offering trip insurance.  Please purchase that if you think you may have an issue with cancelling as it will offer full refund.\n\nIf you have any other questions just ask.",

    "neighborhood": "Near By Destinations\n\nThe Silver Birch Resort is located just a few miles from dozens of attractions.\n\nHorse Show – Traverse City Horse Shows is 3 miles away.  Shows run from June until September.  Check their website for show days and hours\n\nBeaches & Swimming – some of Traverse City’s finest beaches are only 5 miles away on East Bay (due west until you dead end into US31, turn left and immediately turn right.\n\nWine Tasting – Traverse City’s reputation for producing world-class wines is quickly growing as many of the wineries have been winning awards. Most of these wineries call Old Mission Peninsula home. Even if wine is not your on To Do list, the drive through the rolling hills of the peninsula will provide breathtaking views of East and West Bays. The mouth of the peninsula is approximately 10 miles from Silver Birch Resort. After sampling the wonderful wines, you might as well drive to the northernmost point of the peninsula and visit Mission Point Lighthouse.\n\nBreweries – Traverse City and the surrounding areas have a plethora of micro-breweries featuring locally grown hops. Some of our favorites include Shorts Brewery and Stone Hound Brewing Company. Please note: the owners believe in constantly checking the quality of all our local beers. We have never had a bad beer in any of the dozen downtown breweries.\n\nShorts Brewery – 211 Industrial Park Drive, Elk Rapids, MI 49629\nStone Hound Brewery – 3593 Bunker Hill Rd, Williamsburg, MI 49690\n\nShopping – downtown Traverse City with street after street of unique gift shops, clothing boutiques, restaurants, and bistros is only 11 miles away.\n\nElk Rapids – charming Elk Rapids is only 20 miles away. Would you like to see a real-life “Norman Rockwell” town? It doesn’t get any better than this. The beaches are some of the finest in northern Michigan, but sharing this secret will get us in trouble with many of the locals who refuse to tell visitors about Elk Rapids for not wanting to see it lose its “yesterday” charm. Please don’t tell anyone where you got this information. Elk Rapids also has an authentic single-screen movie theatre that was built in the early nineteenth century. You will feel like you are stepping back to a bygone era. The popcorn, root beer & cherry soda is some of the best you’ve ever had. If a movie is desired, be sure to bring cash as twenty-first-century plastic is not accepted. All employees are committed to keeping the old-fashioned movie experience authentic.\n\nRestaurants\n\nBoth Traverse City and Elk Rapids are considered “foodie” towns. Restaurants in our area that serve mediocre food do not last long. Just about every restaurant in this area has good quality food. Some of the owners’ favorites are:\n\nHopscotch Brick Oven & Taproom\n2032 US-31, Traverse City, MI 49686\n\nRed Ginger is located in downtown Traverse City. If you like calamari, you must try the appetizer.\n237 E Front St, Traverse City, MI 49684\n\nRed Mesa on US31 offers Mexican/Spanish dishes.\n1544 US-31 N, Traverse City, MI 49686\n\nPearls in Elk Rapids specializes in Louisiana Cajun cooking.\n617 Ames St, Elk Rapids, MI 49629\n\nMcGee’s in Acme. The closest restaurant and only four miles away.\n4341 M-72, Williamsburg, MI 49690\n\nJolly Pumpkin on Old Mission Peninsula.\n13512 Peninsula Dr, Traverse City, MI 49686\n\nDon's Drive Inn. 50's diner theme with great burgers and killer milkshakes.\n2030 US 31 N., Traverse City, MI 49686\n\nPizza Options\nEast Bay Pizza – In our opinion, the best pizza (partly because the owner’s brother operates it) is East Bay Pizza. Their pizza is outstanding and dining in will also give you one of the best views of the Bay. They also serve 30 flavors of Moomer’s Ice Cream. Moomers won the title of Best Ice Cream in America in a contest sponsored by Good Morning American. A perfect summer night in northern Michigan is defined by a good pizza, ice cream, and breathtaking sunsets on the Bay. East Bay Pizza has all three.\n4386 US-31, Traverse City, MI 49686\n\nThat’s A Pizza – want to eat in? That’s A Pizza will deliver right to your site. This was the owner’s favorite pizza place until his brother opened. They have excellent pizza and a great staff.\n5430 US-31, Williamsburg, MI 49690\n\nSleeping Bear Sand Dunes – named by Good Morning American as “The Most Beautiful Place in America”. People come from all over the world (no joke, Sleeping Bear sees tens of thousands of visitors from Europe and Japan who travel specifically to see the sand dunes. Expending a little energy and climbing the dunes affords you unbelievable views of Lake Michigan and surrounding lakes. You will quickly realize why Good Morning American bestowed this title. The Sleeping Bear Sand Dunes are approximately 36 miles away.\n\nCharlevoix, Michigan – another wonderful, charming town with great restaurants, shopping, and breathtaking views.\n\nGolfing – we are located near three of Michigan’s finest golf courses: The Bear, The Wolverine, and LochenHeath. Check out their websites for all the awards and reviews. These golf courses are only 4 miles away.\n\nThe Bear, The Wolverine, and LochenHeath\n\nTurtle Creek Casino –   If you enjoy the excitement of gambling and the nightlife, you will only be 1.5 miles away from the beautiful Turtle Creek Casino.  In addition to your favorite games, there is a fine restaurant and club with music and dancing.",
    "house_rules": "PET POLICY\n\nWe are dog lovers.  We have two of our own.  We did realize at the end of last year that we must put a pet policy in place. A guest last year left their dog all day in the dome, and it barked the entire time they were gone disrupting the experience of other guests.  This was a dog with a deep, loud bark.  The dog barked for eight hours straight which was impressive as you would think it would lose its voice after a few hours.  Everyone’s nerves were fried by the time the people returned. \n\nWe recently had a guest that asked if they could bring their dog. Even after reading this policy, they let their dog bark for almost an hour. It was not continuous, but it was 5 to 10 seconds of stressed-out, loud barking, and then silence. Every 5-10 minutes there was a barking outburst. I think they tied it up outside, and it wanted to come in the side. The dog was trying to get their attention.  I really did not want to have to walk down there and have a talk with them as we are trying for everyone to have a nice experience. I was very close to walking to their site, and then it stopped for the evening. The problem is the other five domes in the area. This had to disrupt their barbecues, campfires, and evening.\n \nEveryone knows their dogs.  Our two dogs would not bark if we left them somewhere unless they were startled.  This is understandable and acceptable.  If you have a dog that will bark from separation anxiety, we ask that he/she not be left alone (or outside alone while the family is indoors).  If you feel, the dog would only bark if startled, then we are fine with a dog.  If you are going to leave for a few hours, we ask that it be kenneled and left in the kitchen/bath structure – NOT left in the dome.  The kitchen/bath structure has more insulation, and the occasional bark will not travel through the entire property. \n\nThe other requirement we have for pets is that they are not allowed on the beds. We have already had to replace two comforters this year because we were not able to get the dog hair out. Please try and bring a dog bed.  If you cannot, we leave an extra sheet in the dresser drawer. This is specifically for your dog. You can lay this on the floor in an area and your pet is welcome to sleep on this. Dog hair on the comforter is subject to a $100 replacement fee.\n \nIf you agree to these pet policies, you are welcome to bring your dog.  \n\nWe are located on 75 acres and surrounded by thousands of acres of state forestry with trails. You can walk for miles and miles.  This is the perfect property to take your dog for a nice long walk.  If he or she will run after a deer, fox, raccoon, or porcupine, then we strongly suggest a lease as you are sure to see wildlife.",

There were so many birds singing beautifully in the mornings! They've done a great job arranging the elements of the home inside a dome shape, although there's not much to block sound so everyone hears pretty much everything. Be sure to get the check-in message before getting there, because there wasn't any cell service there and I had to drive back toward town until I could get the message and figure out how to get in.",

The moment we got there we were very happy with our choice to stay here.  The unique touches all around. Fresh cut flowers were placed around the house. I feel like they put a lot of thought into many portions of the home. The view was super relaxing and beautiful. The host was very responsive, and left a very nice welcome letter and basket. I would definitely stay again if in the area. Excellent experience!",

Sitting in the hot tub at night and seeing shooting stars was the icing on the cake.\nI was speechless. Had nothing to complain about because everything you needed was there.\nPhil is a great host and responded to all of my questions in a timely matter.\nI definitely want to stay here again.",

The lake view was unreal, it was super private, and the inside of the Airbnb was in perfect condition! The kitchen was so lovely and the board games were a great added touch. The bathroom was unreal. Beautiful waterfall shower, headed toilet seat and bidet and luxurious shower products. The hot tub was pristine and so wonderful! The view from it was amazing! The breakfast bar outside and the bbq were great too. The privacy fences made it feel like we were the only ones there. \n\nHaving the lake and the paddle boards and pedal boat were so fantastic. Our only regret was not bringing our fishing poles and licenses. (If that’s allowed on the lake) \n\nCannot recommend this place more!",

The tub 🛁 upstairs under the skylight was my personal favorite! \n\nIf you want a secluded home for 1 or 10, this is your place! \n\nA very close drive to restaurants and nearby cities with lots to do. Our family visited the caves, the natural chimneys, lavender farm and vineyards, mineral museum, and a water park. \n\nSUPURB EXPERIENCE!",

Such an inviting home! And the host was very responsive and organized with detailed instructions for accessing the property. We loved our stay! The tub 🛁 upstairs under the skylight was my personal favorite! \n\nIf you want a secluded home for 1 or 10, this is your place! \n\nA very close drive to restaurants and nearby cities with lots to do. Our family visited the caves, the natural chimneys, lavender farm and vineyards, mineral museum, and a water park. \n\nSUPURB EXPERIENCE!",

    "summary": "Unplug in your own 3k sq ft private forest dome. Built by a Shenandoah Valley artist, this funky and fun geodesic dome has 4 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms, 2 soaking tubs, Nintendo, books, games, piano, ping-pong, and a deck to watch the stunning stars on at night. \n\n10 min to Grand Caverns, Valley Pike, vineyards, middle river, and many hiking trails. Near JMU. Enjoy the birds, bunnies, and deer.\n\nGroove to our record collection, tour vineyards, workout, or reconnect with friends, family, and yourself.",
    "space": "The dome was built by a local artist in the late 70s, inspired by dome-master Buckminster Fuller and updated again in 2021 to showcase the original retro vibes, but with new, modern twists. \n\nThe house is on 18+ acres of forested land on a hillside. There is a front and side yard that is mowed and plenty of woods to explore for the more adventurous.\n\nYou'll enter from the back deck into an open-concept living area with a dining room, kitchen, coffee bar, and a large living room with high, rounded ceilings and large windows. \n\nOff the main circular living room, there is another den with a video game station, yoga mats, and home fitness gear, as well as a boho floor bed for extra sleeping. \n\nUpstairs there is a master loft king-bed bedroom, a bathroom with a soaker tub and shower, and a separate, open office area with a writing desk.\n\nDownstairs there is another master suite with a king-bed, an ensuite bathroom, walk-in closet, and a daybed for extra sleeping, as well as a table and coffee station. \n\nThere are two additional bedrooms on the main floor, off the den, and both contain desks. These bedrooms share the main floor bathroom and shower.\nOne main floor bedroom contains a queen bed. The other is a \"kids\" room with a full and single bunk bed.  \n\nIn total, the dome has: \n2 King beds\n1 Queen bed\n2 full beds\n2 single beds. \n\nThere is an additional desk and printer in the basement foyer.",
    "access": "Guests have access to the full property, except for the owner's closet and boiler room in the basement and the garage. These areas will be locked during your stay,",
    "notes": "Massages and personal training sessions can be coordinated for you at an additional fee. \n\nHorseback riding, kayaking, tubing, and organic farm visits are available in the area. \n\nThe property is not fenced on the sides, only along the front road. If you'd like to hike up behind the dome and through the woods, chat with us first so we can explain the property boundaries. \n\nPlease note that the Internet at the dome is \"country Wi-Fi\" not \"city Wi-Fi.\" You can stream Netflix etc. on the main TV, but in general, the Wi-Fi is best when used on one device to stream at a time. Att, Verizon, and Tmobile work at the dome but are on country speeds, not city speeds. This is not fast internet. We've tried, but they just don't offer fast internet here. So come to relax and not work! We do not guarantee high-speed Internet. \n\nPlease see our house rules for details on wildlife.",
    "neighborhood": "Encircled by the Blue Ridge Mountains, nestled on a forested hillside in the Shenandoah Valley, the dome is secluded and surrounded by tall trees, rolling hills, farms, vineyards, and the Appalachian mountains. \n\nThis is a great location to explore both Harrisonburg and Staunton as we're halfway between both and 30 minutes from the Massanutten Ski Resort and Water Park. \n\nTake a five-minute drive to the Valley Pike for hot cinnamon buns, lattes, and homemade goodies, or visit their bar and try a locally brewed beer. There is a Mennonite farm a few minutes away that sells fresh produce daily, or hit the Old School food truck for a seriously amazing peanut-butter-and-jelly burger. Yep. Taste the best ice cream you've ever had at Smiley's up the road in Bridgewater. Pick strawberries, blackberries, or pumpkins, or take a hay ride depending on the season.\n\nEasy access to I-81 and the Shenandoah Regional Airport, as well as many antique markets, JMU, EMU, the Grand Caverns, George Washington National Forest, Staunton's authentic Shakespeare Theater, and the Cross Keys Vineyard.",
    "transit": "We have ample parking. The dome is up a long, winding hill. For winter bookings, a 4-wheel drive vehicle is suggested in case of snow and ice.",
    "interaction": "You will have self-check in and we are available if you need us, otherwise we will give you privacy. There is a caretaker that waters potted outdoor plants and picks up the trash weekly. Cleaning during your stay is available upon request.",
    "house_rules": "We cannot guarantee specific Wi-Fi speeds. The Internet works, but it may be slower than you're used to if you're coming from a city. Don't miss your chance to unplug and avoid your emails!\nPhones on ATT, Verizon, and T-Mobile can receive calls, texts, and call out, and usually have 1-2 bars of data. \n\nPlease be aware that we try our best to keep the dome critter-free on the inside, but we're in the forest, so you may see all types of critters outside. \n\nNO HUNTING on the property. \n\nNo pets. \n\nKeep within the property boundaries and do not hike to the neighbor's land. An image of the boundaries will be provided once you check-in. \n\nSmoking is fine outside and on the deck, but not inside. \n\nEvents may be approved on a case-by-case basis with prior permission and an added event fee. Message the host for details.",

The geodome was spacious, relaxing, therapeutic, and full of everything that you need - twinkle lights, sleep masks, extra blankets, kitchen supplies, bug candles, flashlights, cozy chairs, it was fully stocked with everything you’d need. The shared barn has everything as well - microwave, toaster, every kitchen thing you can think of, board games, books, a shower, big table and couches to hang out at. It has everything and it felt so cozy. It’s truly a retreat because you just get there and can totally relax. The communication was fantastic, clear and easy-to-follow instructions. Sara doesn’t give you a million rules like most airbnb hosts do, so you feel comfortable and can truly relax. I’ll be coming back again (and again and again). Thanks for an amazing stay.",

    "summary": "The Stargazer Geodome at DEER LAKE WILDERNESS RETREAT is glamping at its finest. It is the perfect place to relax in nature, reflect on life, and restore your soul.",
    "space": "The Stargazer Geodome features a panoramic window with chairs for curling up in while you enjoy the woodland view. Connect with each other as you sit around the campfire escaping from it all while watching “nature’s tv” under the stars. Snuggle up at night in the king sized bed as you gaze up at the stars through the skylight. In the winter the wood burning stove provides warmth and ambiance. \n\nDEER LAKE WILDERNESS RETREAT is a secluded paradise on 10.5 acres with four acres of woodland trails for forest bathing. Use it as a base to explore the Almaguin Highlands, a four season outdoor getaway known for its scenic hills and lakes. In summer enjoy water sports, biking, hiking, artist galleries, shops, restaurants, ATVing, horseback riding and golfing. In the winter cross country skiing, snowshoeing and snowmobiling are available at your doorstep and dog sledding is just one hour away.  \n\nGuests of DEER LAKE WILDERNESS RETREAT are welcome to use the atmospheric communal space in the barn. In the communal barn apartment you'll find a kitchenette with a stove, microwave, water, coffee maker, tea kettle and all your cooking basics. There is also a sitting area and farmhouse table for your use, connecting at the end of the day in the candlelit barn is a magical experience.  \n\nThe amenities in the Stargazer Geodome include a kettle, french press coffee maker and your cooking essentials such as plates, cups, cutlery, utensils, cutting boards, pots and pans. There is also a BBQ with a side burner on the deck for your exclusive use. It does not have running water but spring drinking water and well water is provided. The Stargazer Geodome is off grid but it comes with a cooler for your perishable food and it has lanterns with a plug to charge your phone. \n\nThe Stargazer Geodome’s washroom facilities include a comfortable outhouse and there is a chamber pot for night time use. There are two hot water showers (one in an outdoor shower house and one in the barn apartment) but both are out of commission during the winter months when the pipes are frozen.\n\nDEER LAKE WILDERNESS RETREAT is a 20 minute drive from the town of South River where you’ll find your essential needs including a grocery store, LCBO, craft brewery, restaurants and pharmacy. The Crystal Caves and its surrounding artisan village is a spectacular way to spend an afternoon and Sundridge, with its quaint Main Street, is just 10 minutes down the road.\n\nNOTES: \n\nAlthough there are three other sites on the premises of DEER LAKE WILDERNESS RETREAT they are spread out and each site has its own private outdoor space. \n\nThere is no TV and WIFI is only accessible in the communal barn, there is no wifi out at the Stargazer Geodome although cell reception in the area is excellent. \n\nDEER LAKE WILDERNESS RETREAT is not directly on water, public beaches are about a 10 minute drive away and your rental comes with a free park pass to Mikisew Provincial Park which has three beaches (one of which is a dog beach). \n\nIF YOU BOOK FOR A FRIDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT PLEASE ASK HOW YOU CAN EXTEND YOUR VACATION FOR JUST $99 ON SUNDAY NIGHT.",
    "access": "Guests have their own private space around the geodome and are welcome to use the communal space in the barn which is featured in the photos.",
    "notes": "There is a welcome package that includes restaurant recommendations and things to do in the area. \r\n\r\nThere are no check-ins on Sundays during July and August",

My arrival was about 10pm, so it was dark outside. Jeannie made sure that I found the Dome easily, so she met us and I followed her to the location. Super friendly and responsive. Wished my 15 year old and I a good night's rest and a pleasant stay. After we had left the next  morning, she texted asking how our stay was and wished us safe travels on our waterfall trip. The Dome was rather quant, cute and charming. My daughter loved the swings hanging from the dome ceiling. I loved all the crystals in each window. Very earthy and a sense of mystical energy. I would definitely stay here again! Namaste.",

You feel like your in a museum inside the dome! Could use some cushions for outdoor space as we used her 2 blankets to sit on the wood chairs by fire. Maybe some twinkle lights in the trees would add some ambiance to the space. Knowing that the property just outside the dome where the bed faces is not her property, made it intimidating to change or shower here. We did see someone walking around in the forest when we arrived. All of my questions were answered promptly and she was very kind.  Overall a good experience though.",

I went to the check-in the office where the host greeted us and signed a waiver. They then escorted me to my tent. They briefed me on the room, the kitchen area, the public washrooms, and how to use the fireplace.\n\nThat being said. Yes, is a cute spot with, beautiful view, and kid friendly. But, it was cold. They do have a pellet fireplace installed, it would run and then automatically turn off due to a set timer or overheated fireplace that was pre set by the owners. Not ideal for the temperature drop we had. Take this inconsideration of winter bookings. \n\nI will definitely be going back this fall with the kids and enjoy the activities they could put on.",

Everything was very clean and pristine.  There was loads of fire wood, bbq, propane, cooking utensils and drinking water. Literally all we had to bring was food, clothes and some bug spray. \n\nThe bed was nice and comfortable and we stayed toasty with the wood stove inside. There is even a little battery pack to operate a light and charge our phones with. \n\nThe outdoor washroom was nicest “outhouse” I have ever used. \n\nVery cool experience overall and I would recommend to anyone!",

Allowed us to do our adventures during the day and come back to the tranquility at night! \n\nThe hosts were great! Very timely at responding, from the moment of check in! \n\nWe hope to be back when it’s cooler to see the change in leaves and enjoy the hot tub!!",

    "house_rules": "TRIP INSURANCE\nPlanning a vacation can be stressful enough when everything goes right but adding a pandemic to the mix adds a whole lot of uncertainty. Trip insurance keeps you from losing your vacation rental investment if you need to cancel for a covered reason. We're here to help if you have any questions!\n\nGLAMPING RULES\nThese are all no brainers but we don't want any confusion so we're gonna state the obvious:\n\n- no smoking (for real)\n- for safety reasons, no pets are allowed.\n- no parties (gatherings not exceeding max occupancy are cool)\n- no horseplay or yelling\n- no rearranging furniture (leave the decorating to us)\n- no confetti or tape on walls (or anything else that would cause damage)\n- no blocking driveways, garages, illegal parking or ignoring posted signage\n- don't enter the unit early without permission\n- use cosmetic wipes or cloths for makeup removal (not our white linen!)\n- Every person over the age of 18 who will be staying on site must sign a waiver\n\nBE A GOOD NEIGHBOR\nPlease have some respect for your dome neighbors. If you make excessive noise or cause complaints by fellow glampers, we reserve the right to revoke your stay without a refund.\n\nTRASH\nGLAMP Dunn Creek by Stay Minty is located in the Great Smoky Mountains which is known for Black Bears. It is critical that you follow all directions and signage regarding the disposal of garbage and trash. Leaving trash out where a smart black bear can get to it can bring all sorts of consequences and can even be dangerous. \n\nMINIMUM AGE REQUIREMENTS\nThe primary renter has to be at least 25 years old. There are exceptions made on a case-by-case basis and with a paid security deposit and our express written permission. Contact us for details.\n\nSECURITY CAMERAS\nWe have cameras on the campground but no cameras inside the dome. \n\nGUEST REGISTRATION\nAfter you book your reservation, simply register your stay within 48 hours to gain access to our guest portal where you'll find reservation and property details, access codes and other details.

Pet Policy Violation\nfrom $950 .......... Smoking Policy Violation\n\nSUPPLY STARTER KIT\nNo one wants to have to worry about getting to the store after traveling all day! That's why we provide a supply starter kit - to get you through the first day or two of your stay. \n\nThe kit includes paper towels, dish sponge, two dishwasher pods, five trash bags, dishwashing liquid, all-purpose cleaner, a small selection of coffee pods, hand soap, shampoo, conditioner, body wash and two rolls of toilet paper in each bathroom.\n\nFIVE STAR GUEST POLICY\nAt the end of the day, this is still camping! We try our very best to deliver the best experience but you should be aware that you are booking a dome in the mountains and are not a hotel with hundreds of rooms or some big company with gazillions of dollars and armies of staff. We're a small team providing good service to good people. We promise to treat you better than we expect to be treated and we ask that you do the same.",

The house is unique and well appointed.  The framing of the house offers interesting acoustics that kept us entertained for hours.\n\nWe enjoyed the firepit late into the Saturday evening of our stay and were amazed at the number of fireflies that came out to join us.  Reminding us of the simpler joys of childhood of chasing them around the yard and failing to realize we do not get to enjoy the same in our regular urban settings.\n\nWe look for unique Airbnb’s to help highlight the few trips we get away and Flat Top proved to be a 10 out of 10.  Unique, Quiet, Comfortable, and not lacking in amenities.  Thanks Kacy!!!",

Enjoy a true glamping experience, private bathroom, a bathtub, and a fantastic outdoor shower.  The dome has one full bed, two twin beds, and a futon.\n\nThe Argentine Geodesic Dome is a harmonious blend of camping and the comforts of home. The luxurious beds are perfect for sleeping in and resting. The bathroom, shower, and tub are the perfect addition to a magical glamping experience.\n\nPlease note that the Geodesic Dome is basically a large tent. During the summer, it gets warm inside the dome during the day (while you're out exploring!) and cools off nicely during the night. \n\nThe cowboy kitchen includes pots, pans, silverware, coleman cooktop, charcoal grill, paper towels, plates, cups, lighter/matches, coffee maker, and toaster.

If dishes are not washed extra cleaning fees may be applied. \n\nNoise: Although we would like for you to be as loud as you’d like, we have to be mindful of our neighbours. Please note that each dome is is 40ft apart so it may be possible for you to hear the neighbouring guests. The domes are not 100% soundproof so you may hear what is happening outside the domes.

Jo & Marianella thought of everything and are wonderful hosts.\nYou walk into your Geodome and feel right at home. The Décor is just beautiful. A welcome basket with all kinds of goodies was a nice surprise. You have your own coffee station inside. The kitchen is in a separate building and has everything from soda, coffee, tea, water bottles & farm fresh eggs. Your private bathroom is only two steps from your dome entrance. \nThe Blackstone Grill was my husband's favorite. He made us breakfast every morning - all dishes, silverware and cooking utensils are provided.\nSitting by the Solo firepit in the evening was so relaxing and we were lucky to have clear nights with wonderful stars....and don't forget your swimsuits. The hot tub is right outside your door!\nSaying Good bye was a little easier with a visit from the goats and a photo op right before check out.",

It surrounds you with warmth, comfort, positive energy and wonderful acoustics.  We are currently looking for that special lot to build our own personal dome residence.  ",

This dome features a kitchen, 1 murphy  tempur -pedic queen bed, 1 bath,  and all the wonderful amenities of home.  Privacy fence and outdoor patio for grilling. Sorry we can't accept pets at this time.  Be sure to play the music channel so you can hear the acoustics!! Only minutes from downtown Chattanooga and all attractions.",

    "access": "Guests have access to the entire space with the exception of the loft.  The loft holds the water heater and WiFi.",

    "neighborhood": "The dome is located 10 minutes from downtown and most major attractions.  The aquarium is on the waterfront surrounded by wonderful restaurants.  From the aquarium you can walk up to the art district and visit the Hunter Museum.  Take the walking bridge over the river to North Chattanooga for unique boutique shopping.  Surrounding the city are top notch hiking trails and mountain climbing.  Tons more to do in Chattanooga the scenic city.",

This 30' Dome gives you 706sqft with all the Creature Comforts of home: King Bed, Full over Full Bunk Beds, Full Indoor Bathroom, Full Kitchen, Washer/Dryer, 2.5 ton Heating and Air Conditioning, Gig Fiber WiFi, Live TV, Firepit and more. Plus the things that you don't get in the City: 30 acres of land to explore, creeks, waterfalls, and walking trails.",
    "space": "Yonah Go Glamping? Brasstown Dome is our 30' Dome that is perched between the trees on the shoulder of Yonah Mountain looking North all the way to Brasstown Bald, over 15 miles away. Actually, Brasstown Observatory is one of the few man made structures that you can see in all of your view. \n\nBrasstown Dome has 706 square feet of living space that is insulated and has a 2.5 ton HVAC unit to keep the dome heated and cooled in any weather. The dome is an open floorplan with all the structure in the middle. Enter the Dome right into a Full Kitchen with full size Refrigerator, sink, dishwasher, and combo oven/microwave, and cooktop. As you walk around the dividing wall, you are in the Master Bedroom with a King Bed and full views out of the 15' wide window that has views of the mountains that you can see from both rooms. Walk around another wall and into a room that has Full over Full Bunk Beds, perfect for kids or adults. Further around the next wall is the Full Bathroom with 2 pocket doors to provide full privacy to your 3'x5' Shower and 60\" vanity, then another pocket door to the Toilet Room. Washer/Dryer unit is stacked in the utility closet for longer stays. 15' ceilings/walls that are insulated give great light and sound dispersion to listen to that favorite vinyl on the sound system. \n\n30 Acres to explore are shared between you and one other dome during the daylight hours. At Dusk, we ask you to stay away from the other dome for privacy. 2 creeks and many springs spill their way down Yonah Mountain and  over waterfalls, through our fields and more springs pop up from underground to feed the Beaver Pond before they run into Duke's Creek and then to the Chattahoochee River.  Bring your water shoes to play in the crystal clear creeks in the warmer months.",
    "access": "You will have the entire Dome and surrounding to explore.",

    "summary": "A tidy private apartment in a secluded & safe Asheville neighborhood. Super Low cleaning fee, and no list of cleaning chores for checkout!\n\nThe garden apartment is large (aprox 650sqft) 1br/open plan unit on the ground level of a unique multi-unit dome building. Fresh bright paints & eclectic decorations that reflect the colorful culture of Asheville!\n\nThe perfect home base for your Asheville getaway!",
    "space": "1 partitioned bedroom features a TempurPedic California King memory foam bed, with plenty of closet storage, integrated charging station, and a lighted vanity with table & chair. \n\nThe bathroom has stone tile floors and a spa-inspired wood panel ceiling with shower, bidet, and toasty space heater. We provide crisp white towels & washcloths- plus shampoo, bodywash, conditioner,  and makeup removal wipes . \n\nLiving room has exposed block walls & beams, with an ample sectional couch that converts to a full comfy Queen bed (no bars or slats!). For rainy days there is a 42\" TV equipped with roku and HDMI cord: log in to stream all your favorites from Netflix or connect your laptop! \n\nThe kitchenette/food prep pantry holds a fridge, microwave, toaster, coffee maker, watercooler, and kettle. It's the perfect place to make sandwiches for your hike, prepare a simple breakfast, or warm up leftovers! Coffee, creamer, sugar and condiments are provided in addition to a few snacks, drinks & ice for your arrival. Compostable plates, napkins, and recyclable cutlery/cups are freshly stocked for each guest.\n\nOutside your private entryway there is a semi-covered flagstone patio with chairs and a tranquil woods view of the mountainside. A nice spot to relax and listen to the babbling creek. \n\n**Accessibility Notice* *\nPlease be aware that the unit is situated on a steep wooded lot which can provide challenges to those with mobility issues. There are several railroad tie stairs from the parking area to the walkway. The path to the entrance is a combination of flagstone walkway and pea gravel, approximately 60' in length. When you reach the door there are an additional 3 deck-style stairs to negotiate. It is impossible to pull a vehicle up to the door for unloading luggage or passengers.",
    "access": "This is an entire private apartment with its own separate entrance there are no shared spaces with the other tenants of the building",
    "neighborhood": "Nestled in Merrills Cove under the shadow of Butler Mountain, the neighborhood is a safe and quiet residential area with just a handful of homes on large dispersed lots. The location feels wild, remote and off-the-grid, yet only 14 minutes to downtown Asheville, 17 min to Haywood Rd (West AVL), 19 minutes to airport, and about 5 min to grocery stores, restaurants, or coffee. The structure sits on several acres along one of the last remaining state-maintained gravel roads in Buncombe county. There is little noise, even less traffic, and virtually zero light pollution. Bears, wild turkey, deer, and assorted other woodland creatures wander thru regularly.  The road is a total of 1.5 miles, gently graded, wide, and regularly maintained.  Perfect setting to step out the door for your morning jog, a sunset bike ride, or just a scenic stroll down to the working farm with goats, cows, pastoral views and (seasonal) u-pick berries or farmstand produce. It's a far cry from sketchy hotel parking lots or crowded city streets with questionable security. The driveway touches some of the greatest motorcycling and road biking routes in the world, plus the closest Blue Ridge Parkway entrance is just 6 minutes away! \n\nQuiet, scenic, and serene best describe the setting. It's got backwoods vibes with central location & the conveniences of city life just around the corner!",
    "transit": "**flatlanders warning**- there are 3 routes into our quiet hollow. The most direct route shown via google maps is usually a steep winding (beautiful) mountain road that could potentially make some drivers nervous. There are two easy flat routes of only 1.5mi further distance, if you have any concerns about mountain driving or inclement weather, please ask your host and we can help you navigate the 'longer' but less curvy route!",
    "interaction": "Contactless and keyless check in/out.  Unit is equipped with smart locks for easy check in on your schedule! You will be provided with a unique lock code in your check-in message.\n\nApartment is well separated from upstairs units with plenty of privacy.  \n\nHost is always available via Airbnb messages. Happy to help with your trip, answer Asheville questions, give directions, or offer recommendations- Or simply leave you alone to enjoy your time!",
    "house_rules": "Quiet hours 11pm-7am\n\n1.  Communicate with your host only through the AirBnB app.  This ensures all conversations are visible to Airbnb customer service personnel.\n\n2.  All guests must be registered in the form of an accurate count. No parties, gatherings, or unregistered guests.\n\n\n3.  One off-street parking space is provided. Large truck/SUV drivers, motorcyclists or those in low/sportscars please contact the host for instructions. Trailers, campers, or RV’s cannot be accommodated.\n\n\n4.  No Pets allowed at any time or for any length of time. There are many wonderful AirBnB’s that allow or even cater to traveling pets. We maintain pet-free accommodation for guests who value an allergen-free environment.\n\n\n5.  Secure all trash. Our mountain property is home to black bear, raccoons, possum, turkey, and more. Trash left unsecured outside for any length of time will be torn to shreds and spread all over. This includes placing trash in outside bins! If you need trash removed from the unit during your stay (smelly takeout containers, diapers, etc) please contact the host and we will remove it to a secure container. If your trash is placed outside and subsequently destroyed, your party is responsible for cleaning it fully or incur a $100 trash cleaning fee.\n\n\n6.  No Smoking inside the unit. In Asheville, we don’t care what you smoke, but it must be outside! Smoking in the apartment will incur a $250 cleaning fee.\n\n\n7.  ‘Back side’ of the property is off-limits to AirBnB guests. Guests are free to explore the area from the creek to the driveway, on the front (street) side of the dome.\n\n8.  No flushing of foreign objects down the toilet. A wastebasket with opaque bags & a bidet are provided.\n\n\n9.  Respect the unit, the linens, and the check-out procedure. You are not expected to clean the unit, strip the beds, or do laundry when you stay at the dome! You are on vacation and we don’t believe guests should be given a list of chores to complete before they check out! Cleaning supplies are provided in case of accidents or if you feel the need to straighten up during your stay. Do not remove towels or linens from the unit. There are extra color/pattern towels in the armoire for guests with hair dye etc.. We also supply makeup removal wipes. Please don't use the white towels for those needs.\n\n \n10.  Acknowledge there are cameras on the property. There are no video cameras inside the unit. For your safety and security, the property is monitored with video surveillance covering parking areas, property, and the AirBnB entry door.",

The room was very clean, a couple of things to mention that weren't accurate in the listing… They do have Wi-Fi, they do provide shampoo and conditioner. Also, one of the previous reviewer's had said some thing about the bathroom door… It is completely fixed, and I can't even see how that could've been a problem to begin with because the bathroom is huge and you feel like you have a great deal of privacy. The place is like a little boutique hotel at treetop heights with gorgeous views right -what more could you ask for to relax?!",

The room was very clean, a couple of things to mention that weren't accurate in the listing… They do have Wi-Fi, they do provide shampoo and conditioner. Also, one of the previous reviewer's had said some thing about the bathroom door… It is completely fixed, and I can't even see how that could've been a problem to begin with because the bathroom is huge and you feel like you have a great deal of privacy. The place is like a little boutique hotel at treetop heights with gorgeous views right -what more could you ask for to relax?!",

It would not close  but also would not even stay partially closed and that normally would be okay however I was there with my teenage kids and it was a bit uncomfortable for all.  We had to use luggage straps to get even partial privacy.  The sheets were not laundered well.  Lots of what appeared to be crumb like pieces and hairs.  We also had some earwigs and spiders in the dome but it is a \"treehouse\" so bugs have to be expected somewhat.  Overall, we would not stay again but we made the most of it.  It did have a nice kitchen area, a full bath and the couple chairs to sit and look outside.  The restaurant food was very good!  The town is small and quiet and we were there for a festival but other than that, not a lot to do except relax and enjoy nature.",

They also had complimentary breakfast and everything was customized to our needs. Couldn’t have asked for better. Jill and her husband let us access the Tesla charger at the venue without any additional charge (this is a game changer for EV owners). They also have a general EV charger. The glamping dome was just as in the pictures. One of a kind yet very clean. My husband and I loved everything about this place and we will definitely be back.",

The house was well stocked with comfortable furniture, kitchen supplies, towels, and entertainment. Issac was very responsive and helpful during our stay. We will definitely be back.\n\nWe didn't feel like it was totally worth the price because there was a big hole in the yard due to the construction; we couldn't get the sauna to work; we had to clean the place, strip the beds and wash dishes; there wasn't a privacy fence from the street or neighbors. \n\nOverall the house and yard were wonderful. It was centrally located to restaurants, hiking, and activities. Issac was a super host.",

Clean, well stocked and very peaceful. We enjoyed cooking breakfast in a clean and well stocked kitchen, relaxing on the couch watching a good movie, having an intense foosball tournament, and of course enjoying a night time dip in the hot tub under the stars. And there is so much to do nearby! Breweries, restaurants, hikes, and some larger towns only a short drive away. Overall, thank you for letting have a wonderful break from our daily hectic life, can’t wait to come back with the kids! (There is even a pack and play and a high chair!)",

It has been photographed, sketched and painted, yet it is ever changing , ever growing just as we all are. \nA former guest sums it up best:\n“I have an aura of happiness here”.",

We saw a little wildlife while drinking our morning coffee. Linda made sure the light was on for us when we returned from dinner. Just make sure to bring some jugs of water; there was no sink in the kitchen - which is clear on the pictures, but we were at a cross as to how to clean the dishes. Which ultimately we rinsed off in the bathroom. I do wish we could have spent more than one night to explore the walking trail and enjoy some more peace and quiet!",

The only missing element may be that the area to prepare food lacks a faucet and sink (water must be brought from the bathroom).  Linda, the owner, was extremely helpful in answering our questions beforehand through the Airbnb site.  She gave us a friendly greeting outside the house when we arrived to give guidance about walking down the hill and entering the house and to answer any other questions.  The location may be a bit remote for persons with medical or mobility issues, but we are septuagenarians and had no difficulties.  We would definitely stay here again.",

The hiking trail was just past the next house over. We liked the trail, great for hiking and biking. \nThe home had some great touches that made it extra relaxing. My personal fave was the gas fireplace outside on the deck and the porch with cozy chair to take in the mountain and creek view. If you’re looking to just veg and mountain bathe without doing much work, I think this is a great spot! Made it easy just to stay in or on the porch and really enjoy it.",
