It looks even better in person and is very spacious, especially for 9 ladies. Danny was a great host, always available for our needs and quick to respond leading up to and throughout our stay. We loved how private the space was, yet close enough to restaurants, other Niagara on the Lake wineries, and Niagara Falls. This is a great space for larger groups who don't want to be in the hustle and bustle of everything but still remain close enough. We also received a complimentary wine tasting at Alvento Winery. The hospitality we received from Danny and his team was unmatched. Not to mention their delicious wine. Thank you Danny for everything and I would book with you again in a heartbeat!",

I am a devout Roger Federer fan and in my free time love playing cards with my daughters, cooking, and taking Oswin on long walks. \n\nMy family has always been in the hotel business so therefore I have naturally felt drawn to working in the Hospitality sector.  Meeting new people is something I love and feels organic to me!  My education is in Business and in my late teens I was fortunate enough to partake in an International Management Program at Walt Disney World, studying their world-renowned training and hotel divisions. \n\nWhether I meet you as a host or a guest, I will always aim to make it a mutual 5 Star experience!

Erica's house is exactly as pictured and described -- modern, comfortable, clean and very well-equipped (especially the kitchen), and extremely conveniently located. And Erica is an excellent host -- friendly, proactive, and very responsive and helpful.\n\nOur primary activity for the weekend was cycling in the area, and Erica's house was the perfect base for us. It is within a few short blocks of many trails in the area, including (and especially) the Niagara Parkway Recreational Trail which runs from Fort George, past Niagara Falls itself, and all the way to Fort Erie. And as an added bonus, there is a garage where you can store your bikes.",

The view is breath taking from every floor of the house, and the balcony and backyard are great to sit outside and enjoy the sunset. The private beach is probably one of the nicest beaches I've been to in Ontario. It was so sandy, warm, and quiet. I couldn't have asked for a better location either. It's just 10 minutes from Port Colborne which has lots of great shops and restaurants. \n\nI would definitely stay again and couldn't recommend more!!",

We liked the idea of staying alongside the locals; shopping at the market; making our own food; and eating at non-touristy places etc.\n\nAfter having such a great experience staying in other people's places, we wanted to provide that same experience to vacationers here in Canada. We bought our own cottages and started Holiday Homes Property Management. We now manage more than just our own cottages allowing us to provide a variety of vacation homes for you to choose from. Let us help you find the right accommodation for your vacation needs.\n",

A quick walk down the road brings you to the beautiful crystal beach and all the cute local shops. Seems to be close to the border for some shopping, and was a 45 minute drive into NOTL! Lots around to keep you busy.\n\nThe hot tub was such a nice treat for an afternoon dip and evening chats with friends under the stars (the lid was dented in the middle, but the actual hot tub worked totally fine)! \n\nIf we had any questions during our stay, they were very quick to respond. \n\nVery quiet area, in a lovely neighbourhood. Once we arrived for our stay, the rules for not allowing large parties, and noise etc. make a lot more sense- it is not the place for a large party vibe!! Great for a girls weekend away, or time away with the family! \n\nHoping to make this an annual trip with my girlfriends, and can’t wait to return!",

Specifically, we do not accept reservations from groups of people under the age 30, nor from all-adult groups who are unrelated.\n\nPlease note that this policy is not intended to be discriminatory, but rather serves to safeguard the interests of our cottage owners and align with their rental insurance policies.\n\nA license is required to operate a short-term rental in Fort Erie, and the license outlines the maximum number of guests allowed in the property.  The limit includes all persons regardless of age.  We cannot approve more people than what the property is licensed for. \n\nOnly the people registered to stay are allowed at, on, or in the property.",
    "interaction": "We are close by if you should need us.",
    "house_rules": "Check-in:  From 4:00 p.m. / Check-Out:  By 10:00 a.m.  \n\nIf you or any members of your group are still at the property beyond the stated check-out time, you will be charged and expected to pay $50 for each additional half hour.  \n\nDue to insurance and local licensing restrictions, you must be 30 years of age to book.  As the person booking the property, you will be fully responsible and liable for all the members in your group throughout the rental period.  This includes any damages beyond what would be considered normal wear and tear.  \n\nDue to the local by-laws, once your booking is confirmed, you must provide us with your full name, address, and email address as well as the full names of the people that will be staying at the property within 24 hours.  This is non-negotiable!  This information is to be kept on file to provide to local by-law enforcement.  If you are unwilling to provide this information, your booking will be canceled.  \n\nA Renter Agreement will be sent to you to complete once your booking is approved.  This Agreement must be completed within 24 hours of confirmation otherwise your booking will be canceled.\n\nYou must be staying in the property.  If we find out you aren’t or won’t be staying in the property, than we will cancel the booking, evict everyone at the property, and you will not be given a refund.\n\nOccupancy:  Due to by-law and/or licensing restrictions, each property has a maximum number of people allowed, regardless of age, on or in the property both during the day and at night.  The maximum number of people allowed is included in the Airbnb listing. Once your booking with the number of guests is confirmed, no additional people will be allowed. If there are more people in or on the property than agreed to, we will cancel your booking; everyone will be evicted; you will not receive a refund; and there will be an additional charge of $500 charged plus hst.  You will be responsible for any and all by-law fine infractions.\n\nWe have a zero tolerance policy for any house party (including wedding and/baby showers), end of school party, or bachelor/ette type parties.  \n\nDue to by-laws and/or licensing restrictions, no tents are allowed in or on the property.  If there is found to a tent, the booking will be cancelled immediately, everyone will be evicted, you will not receive a refund; and there will be an additional charge of $500 plus hst.  \n\nBeach passes:  If beach passes have been provided any loss of Beach Passes will incur a charge of $150 per pass plus administration fee of $150 + HST\n\nParking:  Due to by-laws and/or licensing restrictions, there are a maximum number of vehicles that are allowed to be parked at the property.  This parking maximum is included in the Airbnb listing description.  If we are notified of or find that there are more vehicles than the stated maximum allowed, you will be responsible for removing the overage immediately or risk being evicted and/or charged an additional $100 per vehicle.\n\nWe inspect the property before your check-in time and after your check-out time.  Once you check-in, you must immediately report any damage and/or maintenance issues to us.  If we don’t know about it, we can’t fix it.  We will deal with the issues as quickly as possible.  If anything breaks down or is damaged during your stay, you must report it to us immediately.  \n\nEvery attempt is made to ensure that everything is in working order for the duration of your stay.  Should a breakdown or some other situation occur with equipment or facilities such as air conditioning, dishwasher, microwave, washer, dryer, televisions, VCRs/DVDs, hot tubs, pools, saunas etc, we will make every effort to fix the issue as soon as possible, however, we cannot guarantee that it will be fixed during your stay.  We will not be providing a refund due to the breakdown of these items as they are not considered essential.\n\nIf a breakdown occurs to a fundamental element such as water systems, plumbing and electrical systems, and major appliances such as the stove or refrigerator, every effort will be made to repair or replace, or an appropriate refund will be made for the inconvenience caused.  This does not apply to system breakdown caused by misuse, such as plumbing blockages caused by inappropriate use of sanitary facilities.\nIf electrical services stop because of extreme weather or other circumstances beyond our control, will not be providing a refund.  Similarly, we will not be giving a refund for inclement weather, changes in water levels or water conditions, conditions at neighbouring properties, or any nuisance afforded by nature such as flying insects or the animal population.\n\nUpon check-out, the property should be left in the same condition you found it in upon check-in.  That includes all furniture, fixtures, chattels, and effects (hot tubs and pools included).  If we find damages beyond normal wear and tear, or extra cleaning (including excessive sand, soap residue in hot tubs or pools) is required to bring the property to what it was prior to check-in, you will be responsible for payment to return the property to the condition it was in prior to your check-in. Damages will be assessed and charged to you accordingly plus there will be an additional $150 administration fee plus hst charged.\n\nCleaning:  If the property condition is left beyond normal wear, tear and usage, additional cleaning fees will be applied of a minimum of $50 plus hst.  You are expected to follow all check-out instructions provided.  This includes property use and care of garbage.  \n\nPets:  Unless indicated in the property listing, pets are not allowed at a property.  Even where pets are accepted, you must ask and receive permission from us before you can bring your pet as we do have age, weight, size, type/breed and amount restrictions for pets.  There is an additional charge of $75 plus hst per pet.  If your pet is allowed to stay, you must remove all evidence that a pet was at the property.  This includes the outside area as well.  At no time are pets allowed on the furniture, including beds or in hot tubs or pools.  \n\nIf your dog tends to bark a lot, we ask that you leave him/her at home. There is a noise by-law in effect which includes excessive barking.  If a barking compliant is received, we have no option but to evict you, including all members of your group and your dog from the property.  If this happens, we will not be giving you a refund.  \n\nIf we are notified during your stay or find evidence after your stay that you had a pet and we have not given permission for one, you may be evicted, no refunds will be given, and you will be  charged $500 plus hst.  \n\nNote:  We take no responsibility for any allergic reaction or other conditions arising at any property whether pets are allowed or not.  Just because if says “no pets” does not mean that there have never been pets at the property before.\n\nSmoking:  Smoking of any kind (including, but not limited to, cigarettes, vaping, cannabis or cannabis derivatives, etc.) is not permitted in the property.  Any evidence of smoking in the property will incur additional cleaning charges plus a $150 administrative fee plus hst.\n\nFireworks and Campfires:  You are not allowed to use fireworks (including sparklers) at or in the property.  If you found to have or have used fireworks, you will be evicted without refund.  If campfires are permitted at the property, you can use the designated area to light a campfire, however, you must comply with local fire restrictions.   It is your responsibility to determine whether or not a fire ban is in place during your stay.  Please check the local town or city’s website for more information on fire safety/fire bans.\n\nInformation contained on Airbnb:  The information contained in the Airbnb property listing is believed to be correct at the time of this agreement.\n\nYou are expected to abide by the House Rules and the instructions contained in the property guidebook or any additional information provided by us.  \n\nLIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY:  You accept, guarantee and agree that you will use the property and its facilities in accordance with the house rules above and the property information/instructions provided and that you do so at your own risk.  You indemnify and save us (the agent and owner) harmless from any personal injury, sickness or death, loss or damage, however caused, to person or property of you or the members in your group, before, during or after the time of your rental period.  Further, you accept full responsibility for the use of the property and any recreational equipment such as pools and hots tubs and agree to pay for any damage of said property or equipment beyond normal wear and tear.",

If for some reason there pans are placed in the drawer under the oven, it is not insulated from the oven temp and heats whatever is in that drawer up to oven temp. \nThere is a very large apartment building being built two houses down which does take away a little from the ambiance but didn’t effect the stay. \nTeri was very responsive and answered any questions we had very quickly.",

Spacious and cozy, with good sized bedrooms. The house itself was built in the 1840s so it was charming and cozy. Loved the decor and furniture was great for the space.\nThe hosts were super responsive and helpful. We had some issues with the hot tub (wasn’t reheating for the second night) and the hosts gave us troubleshooting instructions to try and resolve the issue. When that didn’t work, they compensated us fairly for our trouble. \nThe kitchen could use a few more pots and pans. More containers would have been helpful too, as there wasn’t any tinfoil or Saran wrap. There was only instant coffee, but there was a coffee machine so luckily we had brought grinds. Overall we had all the kitchen necessities but could have used a few more functional items. Dishwasher, washer and dryer all worked well - it was nice to have these appliances!\nOverall we had an amazing stay and the hosts were excellent. Would definitely recommend and would stay again!",

The well appointed home is filled with all the luxury finishes, state of the art home technology and elegant feminine decor. Beyond the home itself, she’s curated the perfect menu of vendors for add on services to take your experience up a notch. If you’re not thinking about having a dinner with Mel, you should be! Not only was the food fantastic but so was she. Very kind and personable. Kim over at Sara’s Sweets curated a dessert bar for me and the balloons vendor was on point! None of this would not have been possible to coordinate so simply without the Rose’ House. Gratitude of thanks from our group to you!",

The pluses: sunrise and sunset from the same deck; lake access; floor to ceiling windows that afforded natural light and views of the lake and landscape; simple, retro-modern interior design; comfortable beds; location to food, shopping, history, recreation, entertainment; the kindness and accessibility of our host, Eric. \nWe chose to eat most dinners at the cottage so as not to miss a sunset and found that there was much beauty and lake life to experience right from the deckchair (and with the host-provided binoculars) or from the shallows. This made \"staying home\" just as worthwhile. \nBeautiful place. Attentive host. Note to revisit/recommend.",

House seems recently renovated, modern appliances and fully stocked with all the amenities we needed. We have stayed in quite a few AirBnBs and this was most clean and well maintained by far!\nHaving 3 bedrooms with queen size beds was the main factor for us. This offset the downside of the single, but large and very nice bathroom. It was a bit inconvenient but manageable.\nWe took advantage of the hot tub and the sauna during our stay, what a great bonus. \n\nThe highlight of our stay was renting bikes to cycle around to 5 wineries. Most of the streets have wide bike lanes/sidewalks to travel on as well as the Niagara Parkway Recreational Trail that skirts many of the wineries.\n\nWe would highly recommend to anyone looking for a getaway in the heart of wine country. We can't wait to return here!",

The quiet night in was stone oven pizza and the hot tub. The newly renovated kitchen made the fresh egg’s taste that much better with the fresh fruit from the stand just 2 doors down. Need I say more?",

I am a devout Roger Federer fan and in my free time love playing cards with my daughters, cooking, and taking Oswin on long walks. \n\nMy family has always been in the hotel business so therefore I have naturally felt drawn to working in the Hospitality sector.  Meeting new people is something I love and feels organic to me!  My education is in Business and in my late teens I was fortunate enough to partake in an International Management Program at Walt Disney World, studying their world-renowned training and hotel divisions. \n\nWhether I meet you as a host or a guest, I will always aim to make it a mutual 5 Star experience!

The neighborhood feels clean and safe, but is filled with decay on wooden porches, trim and balconies (not this house. Don’t worry). The sky lights inside can make it difficult to sleep after sunrise but  sleep masks are thoughtfully provided. We couldn’t get the sauna to heat. Be aware the upstairs sleeping spaces are divided but open to the stair cases. The light switches are also a bit confusing. \n\nStunning and quirky spaces abound here. Wonderful items to admire and look at. Unexpected layout and built in features make the space cozy and entertaining.\n\nThe plants are a wonderful feature above the kitchen/in the art room. \n\nThe courtyard is a lovely oasis, but be mindful that there can be small buds on the ground that track inside easily. \n\nThe photo series showing the home’s transformation was very fascinating to see! \n\nAll the beds were very comfortable and we loved our stay! Would definitely stay here again.",

We very much enjoyed the courtyard area where we spent a good bit of our time. The neighborhood was refreshingly diverse, and we had lovely neighbors. My favorite Airbnb so far..

    "summary": "An architectural gem, this home was renovated in the 90s by Buffalo architect David Stieglitz.  You’re sure to enjoy the open floor plan with plenty of skylights, plants, and lush vibes.   \n\nSince acquiring the property in 2012, I have added my own artistic touch, and I love sharing this incredible space with others.  \n\n***This is a dog-friendly space and we welcome your to bring your pup however it is an extra $50 cleaning fee.",
    "space": "This open-concept house features a kitchen with great layout for cooking & entertaining, a living room with a library wall and ladder, wood burning fireplace, master bedroom with claw foot bath, and a built-in SAUNA! There are two full bathrooms with showers. \n\nThe first floor bedroom (queen) adjoins with the downstairs bath.  A second bedroom features a tempur pedicure queen mattress.  A third full sized bed is set up in the upstairs \"art room\" as well. An outdoor enclosed courtyard features lots of plants and Adirondack chairs in the summer.\n\n*In the summer it can get hot. We install 3  air conditioning window units into the sleeping areas.  (Both bedrooms and the artroom).\n\nThis neighborhood houses mostly Puerto Rican families who are friendly neighbors, and in rear of the house I also host guests in the carriage house.  (The patio is shared between guests at both spaces)\n\nThe house is walkable distance to TOPS (grocery store 2 blocks away) &  Allentown bars, galleries, and restaurants.  There are severals parks nearby and LaSalle Park just a 10 minute walk, right along the water.\n\nUber & Lyft are your best options for public transport, however, there are buses and one metro line that can get you to University of Buffalo area.\n\nIf you are traveling with a car street parking is alternating, but there are always plenty of spots available .\n\nStreet parking alternates Monday-Wednesday on the right side between 9-4, Thursday & Friday on the left between 9 & 4.  You can park on both sides evenings & weekends\n\nThis home is unique, comfortable, filled with natural light and quiet.  You'll feel like royalty!",
    "access": "Entire house is yours.  Courtyard is shared with the carriage house guests.",
    "notes": "Check in is after 4pm, check out before 11am*\n\n*We need to get in to clean at 11 for future guests, so unless otherwise specified you will be charged $10/hour cash for every hour you are late checking out.\n\nDogs are welcome at these spaces, so it may not be great for a person with dog-allergies.\n\nWe welcome you to bring your dog, however there is an extra $50 cleaning fee for dogs.\n\nWe do not accept cats.",
    "neighborhood": "Tops grocery store is around a block and a half away for all of your basic needs. \n\nKhari's cafe is just a two block walk (at Jersey & Fargo). They have lovely coffee and breakfast foods. \n\nIf you want to go for a longer walk or drive check out Breadhive Bakery on Connecticut Ave for homemade breakfast and lunch sandwiches. \n\nI love strolling to LaSalle park -- just a couple blocks down Hudson, you walk over a pedestrian bridge and then you’re along the waterfront.\n\nWe are close to Allentown, Canalside, Downtown, and Elmwood Village. You can rent bikes in Elmwood or just walk around.

The sheets are so soft and the beds are comfortable. We chose the queen bed  in the second bedroom which was a little softer, but there’s a firmer mattress in the master if you prefer. We were just there over night on our way to Toronto, but this place would definitely be great for a longer stay! The host was so nice and responsive to messages. Thanks for a lovely stay!",

The bedrooms were big and we chose this place because the beds were either king- or queen-sized. Keep in mind the rooms in the basement can be a bit chilly given the size of the house. Nayem was very quick to respond whenever we had questions, which we really appreciated.",

We really loved and appreciated the fresh and minimalistic decorating and modern touches in the living room and bedrooms. A really relaxed, zen feel. The entire house was so well appointed, exceptionally clean, and spacious. Peaceful and private property, which was very well maintained, with a lovely manicured garden. Loved sitting under the maple trees, catching the warm breeze. Loved the hammock! The barbecue was in great shape - spotless. Nayem was a fabulous host who responded promptly to any questions that I had. He was very accommodating. We are already booking for another memorable stay! Highly recommended.",

Pamela is an exceptional host, friendly, easy to contact & provides an outstanding home away from home. The location is great with many walkable restaurants of all price levels, shops, grocery, and bars. She has a notebook with many suggestions too. The welcome basket as you enter the kitchen has many goodies to greet you. The home is spotless with nice linens, abundance of towels, and comfortable beds. The kitchen & bathroom is modern, appointed with necessary supplies & CLEAN! Easy checkin, spacious, did I say CLEAN?, and a balcony with table & chairs for morning coffee or evening cocktails. I would highly recommend this wonderful place once again. Thank you Pamela & Gerard. See you in December!",

Pamela is an exceptional host, friendly, easy to contact & provides an outstanding home away from home. The location is great with many walkable restaurants of all price levels, shops, grocery, and bars. She has a notebook with many suggestions too. The welcome basket as you enter the kitchen has many goodies to greet you. The home is spotless with nice linens, abundance of towels, and comfortable beds. The kitchen & bathroom is modern, appointed with necessary supplies & CLEAN! Easy checkin, spacious, did I say CLEAN?, and a balcony with table & chairs for morning coffee or evening cocktails. I would highly recommend this wonderful place once again. Thank you Pamela & Gerard. See you in December!",

    "summary": "Just a few steps away from one of Buffalo’s liveliest neighborhoods, this newly renovated apartment has a retro-feel and modern amenities. Buffalo 180 is sophisticated with a hint of whimsy, combining  a craftsman style with fun, mid-century modern décor and vintage furniture. You’ll be tempted to linger but soon you'll be drawn to explore the wide array of unique restaurants, coffee shops, bars and boutiques, as well as the famous North Park Theatre. It’s the perfect buffalo getaway!",
    "space": "Completely renovated in 2019, Buffalo 180’s modern conveniences and brand-new appliances are presented amid dozens of small and large touches that celebrate the craftsman home tradition, all the while giving homage to the much celebrated mid-century design movement. There is true-to-period craftsman trim on windows and doors throughout the apartment, including the bedrooms. Vintage furniture is a major attraction of this apartment, which features pieces from the 1950’s and 60’s including a stunning Montreal dresser, rosewood dining set, comfortable Morris chair, restored mid-century sofa, and classic nesting tables. Art also features prominently, with works by Joan Miro and Charles Birchfield, interesting pottery, knick-knacks and accents recalling the early to mid-twentieth century. \n\nFrom start to finish, we hope to make your stay at Buffalo 180 a journey of delight, touched by history, art and ease. When you arrive, a designated parking spot and keypad makes arrival simple. Then the stairs leading up the private entrance will take the guest past a series of photos celebrating Buffalo’s wonderful, historic landmarks. A replica of the once-celebrated Eames “hang-it-all” is available for your convenience – to hang your coat, hat or scarf.\n\nOnce within the apartment you will have a living room, dining room, kitchen and bathroom for all guests to share. Then there are two bedrooms with queen beds and a third room which can either be a bedroom or a quiet place to read or work. \n\nThe living room is graced with a cross-beam ceiling and built-in bookcases around a fireplace (non-working).  An eclectic set of knick-knacks and pottery grace the shelves, with a few books and games mixed in for when you need a diversion. The Miro prints grace the walls along with a colorful midcentury-style clock inspired by designer A. Cerco. The furniture is stylish yet practical for leaning back and enjoying a movie on the flat-screen smart tv mounted above the fireplace. The tv is set up for you to easily access free Netflix movies, or you can access a wide number of other apps for which you might have an account.  \n\nThe dining room also presents a mixture of stylish elegance and comfort, featuring a gorgeous, vintage mid-century modern dining table in rosewood paired with a matching serving table. The dining table is surrounded by a set of 6 upholstered chairs in an not-often-seen floral design. The three walls feature wainscoting that match the door and window trim, and a Sputnik chandelier is the grand centerpiece. As if to add some humor, in the corner sits a ceramic vase converted into a floor lamp, adding both an artsy flair and a bit more illumination. \n\nBlack-and-white mosaic tile provides the exclamation mark to a bright kitchen with a peninsula, white cabinets, brass designer handles, a granite countertop, and two distinctive craftsman-style light fixtures. Aesthetics aside, this cozy kitchen has ample, quality cooking tools and equipment, basic ingredients, spices, serving-wear and more all within easy reach, making cooking a delight. Brand-new high quality appliances include a double-oven, glass cooktop, full-size refrigerator with water and ice dispenser, and ultra-quiet dishwasher. A microwave and Keurig coffee maker are also available for your convenience. A teapot and drip coffee maker are also stored with a range of other small appliances, including a blender.\n\nThe bathroom is larger than typical for houses of this period and features a modern walk-in shower. A custom barn-door can be securely closed for privacy with a matching, custom-made door lock. A teak spa stool and plenty of shelving to store your toiletries make this a comfortable and functional space.\n\nBedrooms are comfortable and inviting, each simply decorated with art pieces and plump, colorful pillows. Each bedroom has ample storage, and all the bedroom doors can be locked.  Bedroom 1 has a walk-in closet and contains the vintage Montreal dresser. On the walls of the bedroom there are two locally-produced, limited edition prints of sketches of prominent Buffalo landmarks. Bedroom 2 has prints of Charles Birchfield, a famous Western New York artist. If you like his works, be sure to check out the Birchfield Penny Art Gallery on the Buffalo State College Campus. \n\nThe third bedroom has a comfy day bed and mid-century modern desk that can also be used as a vanity. The bookshelf contains typical office supplies as well as diversions from work, like entertaining books and puzzles to feed the minds of guest both young and more mature! (A bigger selection of board games is stored in the living room cabinets.)\n\nIn warmer weather, a large balcony provides a birds-eye view of the street and a relaxing place to socialize or have a drink.",
    "access": "There is one parking space reserved for guests on the left side of the driveway.",
    "neighborhood": "Buffalo 180 is located in the heart of the Hertel Avenue district, and the neighborhood begs to be explored. You don’t need a car to reach dozens of unique restaurants, coffee shops, bar or boutiques – many are within a 5-10 minute walk. A wide range of dining options are available, and to help you choose, we have put together our own collection of original restaurant reviews which will be available when you arrive! \n\nRight in the neighborhood is the North Park Theatre, considered to be the crown jewel of Hertel Avenue. This 100 year-old movie house has been restored to its former glory. With its elegant neoclassic foyer and auditorium, along with six Art Nouveau murals, North Park Theatre’s interior rivals some of America’s best opera houses. Current releases stand alongside art films and classics.\n\nOther cultural and historic gems are just over a mile away from Buffalo 180, including not just one, but two houses designed by the iconic architect Frank Lloyd Wright: the Walter Davidson House and the Darwin Martin House (tours available).

Taxis are plentiful at the airport but not on the city streets nearby Buffalo 180, so you would have to call one of many services available.\n\nBy car you can reach downtown Buffalo and Canalside, our newly developed waterfront district, in less than 20 minutes. Reach Niagara Falls State Park in 30 minutes. \n\nPublic Transportation: \nNFTA Metro Bus and Rail (NFTA stands for Niagara Frontier Transit Authority). \n\nAirport:\nThe Buffalo Niagara International Airport is conveniently located, connected mostly be thruway.\nFor traveling to or from Buffalo 180:\n- via car, it can be less than a 20 minute drive if traffic is light.\n- via public transportation, it will take just over an hour.",

Kids could not play as grass was not cut and it was too much going on. They clean the beds themselves and probably the house too. I was told i couldn’t do an early check in due to the cleaners but when I arrived I was SHOCKED to see the dust and dirt in each room. The bathrooms were also not cleaned properly. You can see piles of dust under the couches in the living room area. My son dropped his toy that’s how i saw it. It could be a very nice place if it’s just maintained proper. The place made me not feel comfortable due to the lack of cleaning. I’m sorry!!!",

We didn’t have a need for the kids play room but there was a sunroom with kids’ toys and high chairs available. \nThe house has it’s own challenges but you get to experience a 200 year old house with modern twist. If you are into historical dwellings this house should give you a kick. The hosts make everything possible to make your stay as comfortable as possible. Given that it’s an old house be prepared to see AC units in the windows but we stayed at the end of July and only needed to use them one night. The bedding looks new and clean. Plenty of towels and the kitchen is fully stocked. \nThe house rules are strict but fare in my opinion. Since it is located on an active farm the hosts do need to make sure that their property is protected and guests respect their labor.",

There were more than enough towels, dishes, and silverware for our large group. The kitchen was great for us to cook in. We even were able to add an extra chair so we could all fit at the table for family meals. \n\nI loved being on the farm. It was so peaceful and quiet and having coffee on the back deck was one of my favorite things to do each morning while enjoying the scenery and wildlife. \n\nEverything we needed was within 15-20 minutes, including making it to the Falls. It was a great vacation and the farmhouse played a major role in that. Thank you, Jacque!",

I think you should share info with Niagara rentals or whoever as it became confusing until I was told info wasn’t shared.\n\nI mentioned to somebody about small issues with trying to unlock the front door. We ended up mainly using the garage and the code. If the front door isn’t fixed, the handle will eventually pull off. \n\nAll in all it is a wonderful place and we had a great visit.

In case of personal injury, emergency, or fire call 911 on house phone (if available). Address of home is on the blue welcome card. During a fire, use fire extinguishers if possible, without harm to yourself.\n\n12. Garbage cans are located outside, as well as blue and grey boxes for recycling. We take the garbage and recyclables to roadside before 7:00 am on Friday. Please ensure garbage and recycling is sorted and taken to the outside storage bins on Thursday evening and prior to your departure.\n\n13. Before leaving, double check that you have not left any personal items behind. Call us if you have forgotten something and you want it shipped back to you at your expense. \n\n14. House Maintenance: Your home is professionally cleaned and disinfected prior to your arrival.\n\n- While we don’t expect you to dust, scrub toilets or vacuum on your holiday, we would ask you to please keep the house clean and tidy (as it was when you arrived). Cleaning up spills immediately protects the finish, and keeping the kitchen clean prevents little critters from feasting on your leftovers. Only use appliances for their intended uses. If the vacation home requires more than normal cleaning after your stay, you will be assessed the additional cost.\n\n- Please help us maintain the home in a good and clean condition by following these simple procedures during your stay and at departure:\n\n     -Place all soiled towels in the bathtub or shower\n     -Run the dishwasher with soiled dishes prior to checking out\n     -Dispose of all waste materials into specific bins outside as instructed upon arrival.\n     -Please clean countertops and stove top of any spills or sticky residue\n     -Please do not rearrange furniture in the house. Outdoor furniture stays outside, Indoor furniture stays inside! You may be assessed an additional cost to your stay if furniture is damaged from being inappropriately treated or the additional time to put furniture back in its designated spot.\n\n15. Odours - Please refrain from cooking foods or creating aromas that linger beyond your stay. If the odours remain and result in relocating the guests coming in after your same day departure, you will be assessed the cost to relocate for one night. Strong aromatic foods can be cooked outside on the grill/BBQ.\nNiagara Holiday Rentals reserves the right to enter the premises to perform maintenance and ensure the vacation home is kept in good repair.\n\n16. Report all maintenance issues promptly. Just as might happen at your own well-maintained home, mechanical failures, disruption of services and other breakdowns can occur. Every effort will be made to correct the situation; however, no refunds or rate adjustments will be made for mechanical and service failures that are beyond our control. Report any damage or breakage upon occurrence so the matter can be settled before departure. Damages found by inspection crews upon departure will be billed and full payment for repairs will be collected via credit card.\n\n17. If bedding and or towels are stained, please do not attempt to clean, this may set the stain. Please let us know as soon as possible and definitely before your departure.  \n\n18. Locked owners' closets are not included in your rental. (If found unlocked, please refrain from taking out additional items or supplies.) Garages do not have guaranteed access for guests. Most are for owner usage only and are not included in your rental.\n\n19. If you are in a vacation home with a sofa sleeper, these are best suited for children and may be uncomfortable for adults.  \n\n20. Slipper Policy (if slippers are provided): To protect the floors & carpets, guests are asked to please remove their shoes inside the house. Slippers are provided. (Persons with disabilities are exempt). \n\n21. If pet friendly, we allow one small dog with prior confirmation at time of booking. No additional animals are allowed on the property at any time. Pets should not be allowed to be on the beds or furniture. Please do not leave pets unattended for long periods and do not allow your dog to keep bark continuously inside or out.\n-There is an additional pet fee of $100 that will be added to your reservation after booking\n-Only one small dog allowed.\n-Pets must be at least 1 year old.\n-If damage is caused, the cost of the damage or additional cleaning required will be taken from your damage deposit and/or charged to your credit card.\n-Please pick up after your pet. Any pet waste not picked up will incur an additional clean up charge.\n\n22. If the home has a wood burning fireplace, only fabricated fire logs are permitted. Use only one log at a time, it will last 2 to 3 hours. Do not use wood even if available. Do not use twigs or scrub brush. Chimney fires are always a concern. Fabricated logs burn cleanly, and the cleaners do not have to worry about hot coals when they come in after you depart. Some fireplaces have been labeled do not use. These have chimney’s that have been blocked off.\n\n23. Absolutely no fireworks or outdoor fires are permitted on the premises.\n\n24. Loss or damage: We reserve the right to charge for any loss or damage etc. assessed upon departure. If extra cleaning or sanitizing is required over and above what would be considered normal wear and tear, a minimum fee of $500 fee will be charged to cover these extra costs.\n\n25. During your stay we may have some maintenance work done on the outside of the home such as mowing, trimming, cleaning BBQ/grill, tidying up patio and pool/pond maintenance (if applicable). \n\n26. The continued growth of our area is evidenced by new construction that may be adjacent to or near existing vacation rental properties. We regret any inconvenience but cannot control these situations. Refunds or relocations cannot be considered \n\n27. Telephone (if available) International calls outside North America, made during your visit will be charged to the credit card number provided at the time of your reservation. Any additional pay per view or cable TV charges will also be charged.  \n\n28. Guests must be aware of and adhere to all Niagara-on-the-Lake by-laws, including Noise (By-law 4588-12) and Public Nuisances (By-law 4397-10 &4397A-11). Any fines levied as a result of a complaint during your stay will be charged to the primary guest. You must also ensure that every person being accommodated is complying with any applicable restrictions on the size of social gatherings and organized public events. \n\nWe understand that you are on vacation and realize that the above may seem strict, but many of these policies are meant to ensure safe enjoyment for yourself and your guests, but also to reduce wear and tear on the home and ensure the quiet enjoyment of neighbours.\nFailure to comply with any of the above or for any reason determined by Niagara Holiday Rentals, will result in you and your guests immediately vacating the vacation home. If you are requested to vacate before your scheduled departure date as a result of not complying with the Terms and Conditions of Occupancy, you are not entitled to any refunds.\n\nYour vacation rental home is privately owned by a Homeowner and managed by Niagara Holiday Rentals,",

The patio hot tub was easy to use and at the perfect temperature. 2 washing machines and 2 dryers...couldn't ask for anything more. The deer were walking right up to the house and almost looking in the windows. Plenty of wild life to see. I would love to return in the summer and walk the trails.",

We loved going to the bakery and the juicery and made a quick stop even at the library.  The cottage is great for a big family with lots of room to spread out.  Thank you Jamie!",

The location is excellent, a block from Queen St and across the street from Balzac’s Coffee Shop. Our toddler thoroughly enjoyed going up and down the carpeted stairs (a million times) and waking up to watch the squirrels and birds from the upper front porch and backyard. The basement’s air hockey table was also a nice added bonus! Grandparents and us enjoyed having our own private ensuites, with baby in his own room for naps and nighttime. Despite proximity to shop and restaurants, and a pub across the street, it was a super peaceful and quiet home. Our only issue was with cleaning upon arrival and some inflexibility regarding requests for early check-in and late check-out, but, other than that, we had an excellent stay and would stay here again!",

Also a grocery store within walking distance and an unlimited amount of restaurants and shops. It was lovely too to take a walk to the lake/gazebo. The front porches, especially the upper level, are amazing. We loved to sit there with some charcuterie from the cheese shop a block away and relax. The 3 bed 3 bath is the perfect set up for a family to stay. Note the bathrooms have pedestal sinks with no counter space - small tables have been added which were very helpful. We had a minor issue with the back shower on the first morning and they promptly came over to address the issue. The kitchen/dining space is perfectly equipped and we made breakfast each day before heading out. There are TVs in every room though we spent our relaxation time on the upper porch. Many wineries within a few miles. We loved it!",

You are minutes to the lake and all the town favorites.\nWe listened to a wonderful band called the Feverish Lemons at the Irish Pub across the street. We woke up every morning to a fresh cup of coffee from Balzac's coffee shop across the street. I would highly recommend dinner at Ginger's Restaurant, it was our favorite! \nWe  are already planning a return trip next fall!!!",

Please fill and turn on the dishwasher, and gather all trash and place in the receptacles provided outside to the right of the mudroom door, as leaving.   We thank you very much in advance.  \n\nCheers, Team Freedom",
    "neighborhood": "Our beautiful Vineyard Manor House is situated on the grounds of our family run vineyard, with views overlooking acres of vineyards and fields planted with a rotating crop of corn, wheat and soy beans.  There is also a 1000 tree apple orchard, which produces our much sought after ‘Apple Jack'. \n\nYou get the tranquility of country living at the Vineyard Manor House, yet you will see luxury buses and stretch limousines pulling up to the tasting room, which is located just next door.  Please feel free to walk around the  property, but be aware, especially with kids, that this is a working winery, with tractors in the fields and vineyards on a daily basis.  Pets must be kept on a leash.\n\nThe house is easily accessible to the town of Lockport for local shopping.  You may wish to take a tour boat up the Erie Canal, see the Lockport Underground Caves, visit the Erie Canal Discovery Center, and Lake Effect Ice Cream which offers unique flavors like Whiskey Brown Sugar and Frozen Hot Chocolate…yum! \n\nThere is a thriving art and performing arts community in Lockport so be sure to check out The Palace Theater and The Kenan Center as well as local artists at the Market Street Art Studios.  \n\nThere is so much to do in the area, including weekly classic car shows, and open air farmers markets in season.   Not to be missed are the beautiful Tiffany stained glass windows at the First Presbyterian Church.\n\nCheck out the lineup of world class entertainment at the outdoor concerts at Art Park in Lewiston, where there is a wide variety of great restaurants.  There is also an amazing nature trail overlooking the Niagara River at Art Park in Lewiston.  \n\nThe Herschel Carrousel Factory Museum in nearby North Tonawanda is a historic carousel factory complex which was constructed in 1910-1915 and hosts a working carrousel with  36 hand carved horses and over 580 lights.\n\nIt is a short drive to Niagara Falls, one of the most beautiful natural wonders of the world, and the honeymoon capital of the world.   The locals park on 'Goat Island' and take a short stroll to see the Falls.  \n\nWhile in Niagara Falls, be sure to check out The Niagara Falls Culinary Institute which is like visiting the kitchen of a five star restaurant, as they sell what the 'chef's in training' create, and they also feature the wine from  Freedom Run Winery.  \n\nThe city of Buffalo is approximately 45 minutes away, and is full of wonderful things to discover.  Take a tour of The Frank Lloyd Wright Martin House and the Albright-Knox Art Gallery of modern and contemporary art.  \n\nCheck the calendar at The Shea Preforming Arts Center and don’t miss having a wonderful meal at The Bijou Grill which is right across the street, or if you like an unusual menu, check out the The Black Sheep or our favorite The Billy Club.\n\nWhile in Buffalo, check out the Darwin Martin House National Historic Landmark, which was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright and built between 1903 and 1905, and if you have time, also take in the Albright–Knox Art Gallery which is a major showplace for modern and contemporary art.\n\nIf touring the other wineries is what you are looking for, just pop into Freedom Run Winery and pick up a map, or go to the Niagara Wine Trail website for more information.  \n\nYou can also check out our Underground Railroad Freedom Art Walk to learn more about the history of this sacred land which features in the story of the Underground Railroad.  Or you could simply relax in the back yard overlooking the vineyard with a glass of wine on the covered patio!\n\nWe look forward to welcoming you to the Vineyard Manor House at Freedom Run Winery.",
    "transit": "You will need a car, and there is plenty of parking.",

Don't be a stranger in the Tasting Room as there is always something interesting happening.\n\nYou will have as much privacy as you like at the Vineyard Manor House,  and please feel free to walk the grounds, but please be mindful that it is a working winery, with machinery in use.  \n\nCheers, Team Freedom",

After my kids had a messy/fun time playing in the sand, it was really nice having that separate entrance leading to the back deck, into the outdoor shower. The kids loved that! \nWe had beautiful weather while we were there. Got to enjoy the lake, have a fire, grill out, go on the wine trails, go to the drive-in, play some really fun board games and just created long lasting memories there. \nThis has been my 15th year going to Van Buren and my husband 30 +. VBP has such a special place in our hearts. We will be booking again for sure!",

    "space": "Leave it all behind and escape to the most wonderful place on earth; the charming historic \"gated\" community of Van Buren Point on Lake Erie. Here you will find many darling cottages, each cleverly named, well cared for and loved generation after generation. But you will find that there is only one cottage that will make your trip truly unforgettable and its our \"Valhalla\".\n\nValhalla is a beautifully upgraded, exceptionally maintained, and well equipped year-round cottage with 4 bedrooms and 1.5 bathrooms which can sleep 10. You will love the beautiful views of the bay which can be seen from the 3 season porch, living room, and the upstairs. \n\nAs you enter Valhalla, you will discover the stunning knotty pine interior and hard wood floors that really make this cottage stand out. The vaulted ceilings and open loft give the tastefully furnished living room a warm and inviting feeling. Accenting the room is a beautiful gas fireplace for you to cozy up next to on those chilly nights.\n\nOn the first floor you will find 2 generously sized bedrooms, each with its own closet and queen bed, so you can make yourself right at home! Conveniently located right next to the bedrooms you will find the full bathroom with shower/bathtub.\n\nOff the living room you will find the large well equipped eat-in kitchen with many nice features including a double oven, microwave, dish washer, garbage disposal and quartz countertops.\n\nJust off the kitchen you will discover an additional newly remodeled living/dining area. Here you can relax on the comfy new pull-out couch and watch a movie. Gather around the dining room table with seating for 6+ for a good old fashion family game night or enjoy your home-cooked meal in front of the bay window with a view of the lake.\n\nAs you leave the kitchen you will find the washer and dryer as well as a half bath. Head up the stairs and you will see the loft and a large bedroom containing a double and two single beds. \n\nStep outside you will discover an over-sized private fenced-in yard and a large 2 tiered enclosed deck which features a private outdoor shower. Take advantage of the beautiful weather with a cook out on the large combo gas/charcoal grill and enjoy your meal on the picnic table. If you don't want to walk to the beach for a bonfire, relax in the Adirondack chairs and make your own in the backyard fire pit.\n\nAfter a night in one of the comfy beds, wake refreshed and ready to seize the day. Head to the porch to relax and enjoy the tranquility of the morning as you sip your coffee and watch in awe as the sun slowly begins to rise over the lake. \n\nHead outside to enjoy all of the awesome amenities VBP has to offer. Walk or ride bikes to the beach to take a dip or do some boating. Bask in the sun and take in the gorgeous scenery as you walk the beach looking for sea glass or wood for a bonfire. When you have had enough of the beach jump on your bike and cruise to one of the many parks located in VBP. Play on the playground or play a game of tennis, basketball, sand volleyball, horseshoes, or bocce ball. After dinner take a stroll over to the beach in time to catch a spectacular sunset over the lake. \n\nIf you are in the mood for a little excursion there are plenty of things to do in the surrounding area. Follow the Chautauqua Wine Trail to discover and enjoy western New York's local wineries. Lake and stream and ice fishing is available nearby! A short drive will get you to Buffalo, Niagara Falls or ski resorts and much, much more.",

The house was very clean and the master suite was very luxurious! Great space to entertain in the kitchen/living area and the outside patio was great! We spent most of our time at the fire pit and were provided with unlimited fire wood by our hosts. The only slight downfall was that the hot tub was not functioning properly on our arrival night. We contacted our host and she was very quick to respond and remedy the situation. We had a repairman arrive the next morning to fix the issue but unfortunately we did not have enough time to reheat and put it to use before we left. No worries though, because there was plenty to do in Ellicottville! We had a blast at the aerial park and riding the mountain coaster.

The five bedrooms provided ample space for all of our group with the extra 'small' beds well-placed and comfortable. The area at the lake is as stunning as the pictures and we enjoyed the firepit and lake views as well as morning coffee on the rooftop terrace. The younger members of our party enjoyed the pool area. \n\nA few notes: The kitchen is well stocked for eating and drinking (i.e. lots of plates, cups, utensils, etc.) but not as well stocked for cooking (i.e. pans, oven mitts, baking sheets).",

House and furnishings are very high quality, clean, and stacked with amenities to keep everyone busy and happy! We stayed with two other families (6 adults, 3 kids total) for 5 nights and couldn’t have had a more pleasurable vacation. Compliments to Host Dean on being very communicative throughout our entire stay. The place isn’t cheap, but then, this is a perfect example of you getting what you paid for! We highly recommend!!!",

Some lovely artwork and a plethora of lighting options! \n\nThe adjoining neighbours do have small children and it was quite noisy at times when we were there during the day/early eve but thankfully not at night.\n\nPlenty of food options in Leslieville itself (loved Chula) but so easy to get in and out of GTA on the streetcars and buses. You need a presto card first (we dodged a fare on our first use as we didn’t have a card and didn’t have any coins to purchase a ticket in the streetcar!) which you can buy in Stations or Shoppers Drug Mart.\n\nThe No.83 bus (Jones Ave and Sproat) will take you to Loblaws for all your food shopping needs, and back again).\n\nWe had a lovely stay and really enjoyed exploring Toronto.",

The backyard is gorgeous, the house was spotless and well appointed, and our host was quick to respond if I had a question. (She also reached out a couple of times with additional helpful information.) We were a little surprised at how well sound carried throughout the house, but it wasn't an issue for us. The rooms were comfortable, and having a washer and drier available for our use was really helpful. The neighborhood was quiet, and the house is located in a low-traffic neighborhood. Our friend got married at the Royal Canadian Yacht Club, and the house was just a short Uber ride to the RCYC ferry.\n\nI would definitely recommend this home to anyone looking for a place to stay in Toronto.",

Highend fixtures with a wonderful master bath and closet. The neighborhood was full of people as it sits on a lake with a local park nearby. But it wasn't loud and we felt completely safe even with all of the foot traffic.  Communication with the host was easy and he was very responsive. The only minor issue was that the home wasn't as clean as I would have liked (towels were still drying upon arrival, some dishes still dirty) but I likened it to the fact that the last guest vacated earlier that day and the cleaning crew was pressed for time. Post-covid, I am extremely particular about cleanliness. I did inform the host and he addressed it. If I'm ever in town again, I would definitely stay here again! Hands down.",

My family and I came from AZ for my brothers wedding and we wanted a large enough space and this home was absolutely perfect! We didn’t feel on top of each other, there was so many accommodations, the home was clean and beautifully decorated. Bryan was so sweet and even worked around some of our accommodations with needed to stay an extra day. He was so sweet and stopped by with warm pastries and was very pleasant. I would HIGHLY recommend this home. The backyard was beautiful ! Pool was immaculate. We even drove up to Niagara Falls for the first time ever after his recommendation with it not being a bad drive (maybe 35-40 min) well worth it! This was an amazing weekend and I’m so thankful !",

The island in the kitchen became an instant meeting point for conversation, cooking and meals together. The family room was very inviting with many places to cozy up by the fire. The beds were very comfortable. Well stocked with linens and towels. Media room was perfect for movie night and watching all the Christmas classics. Given the time of year we weren't able to enjoy the amazing grounds but definitely are thinking of a return visit in the summer to enjoy! Bryan was easy to get ahold of when we needed him and made sure we had everything we needed. And the espresso machine rocks!",

We were able to wash and dry our clothes when we came back soaked from our niagara falls boat ride, super convenient. This house was very spacious and made our trip great.",

Also I do wish we have face towels (none in unit) and more linens available. But honestly, the overall experience was lovely. I highly recommend!",

We are infant-friendly, with play pen, by-your-side sleeper, play mat, portable rocker & baby dinnerware. Free parking for 2cars",
    "space": "This apartment is in the main floor of a detached house. It has 3 bedrooms and 2.5 washrooms: 1 king bed, 1 queen bed, 1 twin-over-double bunkbed, a living room, dining area, and a full kitchen.",

    "notes": "We also have rental properties in Hamilton if you want to visit the city or stop by on the way to Niagara Falls. Please find them using the property names, or feel free to ask me:\n\n3-bedroom main floor apartment - Name: \"Hamilton: 3bdrm, king bed, large patio, near trail\"\n\n1-bedroom basement apartment with a king bed and a double-sized sofa bed - Name: \"Greenhill bsmt unit | King bed | Spacious patio\"\n\n1-bedroom basement apartment with queen bed - Name: \"Bsmt apartment, quiet neighborhood, free parking\"",
    "neighborhood": "The best part about this neighborhood is quietness and safety. You can see few cars travelling on the road right in front of our house but can easily blend in the traffic once you get out of that road. What our guests love most is having a park right behind our backyard and our proximity to nearby trails and sightseeing places. As you may know, Mississauga is the second-most populous city in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) after Toronto itself, third-most in Ontario, and seventh-most in Canada. Mississauga is historically known as Toronto Township - its growth was attributed to its proximity to Toronto. Plus, it can be considered to be an ideal stop between Toronto and some other cities such as Oakville, Burlington, Hamilton, and Niagara Falls.",

      "about": "That pic was taken of my dad and I when we were traveling throughout Ireland a few years ago! Brandon (my other man) & I are lovers of travel, anything adventure & outdoors, cycling, ice hockey and animals. We are bee keepers and rehabbers. We spent 4 years tearing this old building down, rebuilding it and in-between we discovered an old barn with a lot of character. With some grit and a whole lotta help we spent many days & nights piecing together around the integrity of the original structure. At a few points we thought about burning it,  some days I wanted to call Joanna Gaines and ask her \"how the heck do this\"? Then there were the thoughts of just walking away but, we pushed through. It's not perfect, but it's pretty darn close... and such is life. We hope you are traveling with someone you can take time to really enjoy the moments with and make amazing memories with in our labor of love. We especially hope however short or long, you make your stay in Ellicottville a special one. Enjoy the memories, live for the moments! All our best, Kristie & Brandon ",

I dont recall this in the listing, but I may have missed it. our kids loved running to the deck and watching the trains go by. \n\nWe did have an issue the first night with no hot water, but Alair was able to get that fixed the quickly the next day. \n\nThe house is about a half hour from a grocery store, which isn't idle, but not awful, and not a lot of restaurants nearby. Regardless, we had an amazing time, and used the house as a base for our vacation around Letchworth State park. \n\nWould gladly stay here again if we are in the area!",

I own a graphic and website design firm called - Blue Tomato Design and an interior design firm called Blue Tomato Spaces.  I LOVE to renovate and restore old spaces. My two dogs Moggy and Mosey, love being at Blue Oar Lakehouse and Blue Canoe Lake Cottage!\n\nThe surrounding Lake Erie area is so beautiful and the people of this small Western NY town are so nice!  I fell in love instantly as I'm sure you will too. In the summers, drive to Bemus Point on Chautauqua Lake and have drinks at the Hotel Lenhart in the rocking chairs on the porch and watch the sunset and then head over to Ellicottville Brewery for dinner.  Saturdays are great days for beer tasting and live music at Southern Tier Brewery or exploring the Wine Trail. Sundays are usually spent at the lake just relaxing, kayaking and swimming. Private beach areas with fire pits at both Blue locations - right on the water. In the winter hit up Holiday Valley ski resort and then head to Ellicottville Brewery for drinks and dinner before heading back to the lake. Tarbox Road Recording Studio is a 4 minute drive. Lily Dale is only a 2 minute drive or easy walk. Open year round.",

Grundsätzlich war im Haus alles vorhanden. Gerne hätten wir Zeit draussen im kleinen Garten verbracht. Allerdings vermissten wir einen Gartentisch mit Stühlen und einen sauberen Grill, den wir gerne genutzt hätten. Da wir viel unterwegs waren, nutzten wir das Haus nicht voll aus. Deshalb für uns preislich am oberen Limit. Die Kommunikation mit Joshua und Heather war jederzeit einwandfrei!",

      "about": "Hello dear!  I’m Jenny, I’m so glad we met here!  When I was a child, I was born in a rural village in China. When I was young, my family’s economic conditions were not good. 20 years ago, my parents gave me very little amount of money to go outside to work.\n\nFortunately, after working hard for a period of time, I accumulated a little bit of money and then I borrowed more money from relatives and friends.  Then I started my life’s business. I rented a shop along the street. It was only 9 square meters. I needed to open the shop during the day. At night I closed the rolling door and laid a mat and quilt. The concrete floor is my bed. I have been sleeping from August in the summer to winter in December and keep on the concrete floor every night for more than 4 months. Since then, I have had a beautiful dream and a wish in my heart. I hope everyone can sleep in a comfortable bed at every night in the world, Everyone can have a warm and comfortable home in the world, and wake up happy every day from their sweet sleep and start an energy day!\n\n So fortunately, I met the Airbnb platform three years ago, which allowed me to realize my dream. It can really provide every guest with a comfortable accommodation, just as warm, lovely and clean as guests living in their own homes , Comfortable, and extremely satisfied!\n\nI treat every guest as my family. I believe that every guest who has stayed in here before they can deeply feel that my enthusiasm was really from my heart. I provide guests with high quality beds, bedding, furniture, and home appliances, Kitchen supplies, etc., these are all brands that I am using now, and even some home appliances are more high quality than I used. I love my passion business and which can provide warm and sincere love to all customers. It is precisely because of my enthusiasm and love from my career, even if I finished cleaning the toilet each time that I feel very proud and so happy, because I can imagine my guests if he or she using the toilet that they will definitely feel Jenny's dedication and warmly heart, love, honestly, passion,  the guests will be so happy because each room is So clean, so neat, so beautiful, and so comfortable!\n\n I always say to my guests: \"My dear, Here will always be your own home if you have  lived here, You are very welcome to come back home again anytime, and the lights at home will be turned on for you at any time!\" In fact, It’s really the truth, All the guests who was lived here before they all loved the stayed very much. Thanks God for arranging we meet each other, Love you my Dear!  God will always bless you and Your family Dear!",

    "summary": "As one of only a hand full of residences that back directly onto Trinity Bellwoods park this home offers the perfect combination of downtown access with park-life energy.   A chef's kitchen, open floor plan, large bedrooms, dedicated workspace and flower filled back yard make this location a perfect home while working or exploring the city.  Steps away from Queen West and Ossington Street, two of the most dynamic neighbourhoods in Toronto.",
    "space": "The house was built in 1889 so get ready for some \"old world charm\". The Victorian details of the house have all been preserved, and the floors my slope a bit but the interior has been updated with a modern kitchen and comfortable contemporary design.  \n\nThe central air conditioning works well on the main floor but as is the case with most older homes,  has a bit of trouble cooling the second floor so fans have been provided in each room to help with the occasional heat wave.  Large trees in the front and in the back of the property provide great natural shade. \n\nSince this is a \"family home\" as opposed to a full-time rental suite,  the vibe is pretty quiet and family oriented. \n\nThe back gate of the property opens into Trinity Bellwoods park where there is plenty of green space, tennis courts, as well as a splash pad and play ground for children.  The Trinity Bellwoods Community Centre offers free open swimming and other free weekly activities for children.",
    "access": "Guests have access to the basement, main and upper floors of the home as well as the back yard (private).  There is a rental suite in part of the basement but it is entirely separate from the laundry facilities that you will have access to which are also in the basement.",
    "neighborhood": "Queen West voted the second coolest neighbourhood in the  world by Vogue Magazine: \n\n\"Toronto is currently enjoying newfound prominence—and desirability—amongst globe-trotting tastemakers. Queen Street West is a verifiable artery of indie patisseries, homegrown labels, and hidden-from-view galleries—hallmarks of hipness, if ever they existed. It’s also the home of well-established “art” hotels The Drake and the Gladstone, and Soho House Toronto is nearby, as is Graffiti Alley, a block where street art is both 100 percent legal and lauded\"",
    "house_rules": "Reservations must not exceed a maximum 4 guests.  The number of guests must be respected.   \n\nPlease be aware that this is a family home and not a hotel so please do not move furniture, lighting or artwork.    Ample space will be made in all bedroom closets but some personal items may remain in view.  \n\nThere is a permanent tenant in the basement suite so please be mindful of the noise level on the main floor by removing foot ware indoors.",

The beds were very comfortable. The chalet was in a quiet, secluded area, surrounded by nature, and just minutes from town. We enjoyed meals outside on the wraparound deck, relaxing in the spacious spa and spending quiet, starry evenings at the fire pit. Jaclyn was extremely attentive and always responded promptly to our to our questions and requests. We have already booked our next stay at the chalet!",

The hiking trail right behind the house was super cool too. Seems so far away, although town is only about 7 minutes away. The house is better than the pictures. Kitchen was equipped with more than we expected. So much space for all 9 of us to be there comfortably. We even ended up adding an extra day because we just weren’t ready to leave!! Can’t wait to come back. Thank you Jaclyn, for your great hospitality!!",

I chose this house not only because of the location but the Superhost  status .It was not at this level . The outside area was full of spiderwebs , dining table filthy and area had not been cleaned in a long time .Inside the countertops were grimy and there were bugs in the windowsills.There were extremely expired eggs in the refrigerator. I do not believe there is a professional cleaning company due to the fact that we found a dirty diaper on the floor in the basement guest room . Although Beck  was responsive when I asked about an iron and extra towels I appreciated the effort but it wasn’t enough to minimize the other issues. There also weren’t enough instructions in the house for appliances or navigating things in the house  or a book of recommendations, the little added touches that go along with a Superhost.Once the dirty diaper was found I lost any comfort level I initially had in this house.",

The lack of stuff like extra towels,  hand towels, cookware, all the clutter and dust on all the stuff, and the spider webs everywhere that have been around for a while made things annoying. But with that said the place was still amazing and made even better by having a great host who is aware of my comments and intends to make some changes for future guest. all in all if changes are made I definitelyrecommend",

For hygienic  purposes, it is better to provide a personal size of toothpaste and brush. Maybe some beds need to be replaced, as it was sagging.\n\nOverall, it is excellent. I will consider coming back again.",

It’s very spacious and has  all the amenities that you could possibly think of (appreciate the snacks, bottled water etc.). The kitchen is beautiful and has everything you need. There are plenty of stores around the area (two Walmarts within 2 mile radius ) restaurants, and Asian supermarkets to get everything you need. The location is also pretty close to downtown Toronto (35 min drive), as well as to Richmond Hill and Markham where there are plenty of great Asian restaurant. Would definitely come back in the future for my next visit.",

I was traveling with my “ Vacay Squad” which consists of ten of us (this trip).  5 adults , 2 teen boys & \n3 young ladies . We had plenty of room to spread out . Basement had air hockey table and other things for the kids to do right outside the 4 bunk bed room . There was a large table for us to all come together to enjoy dinner as a group . There was a complimentary grill to be used which made dinners a breeze . Hot tub was very nice and the Sauna was a big bonus . Kitchen was fully stocked with anything we could have thought of from dishes to silverware , pans , even garbage bags under the sink with dishwasher tabs , 2 different coffee pots (k cup or regular). This house was also beautifully decorated . I would highly recommend this house and Jaclyn as your host !",

I was traveling with my “ Vacay Squad” which consists of ten of us (this trip).  5 adults , 2 teen boys & \n3 young ladies . We had plenty of room to spread out . Basement had air hockey table and other things for the kids to do right outside the 4 bunk bed room . There was a large table for us to all come together to enjoy dinner as a group . There was a complimentary grill to be used which made dinners a breeze . Hot tub was very nice and the Sauna was a big bonus . Kitchen was fully stocked with anything we could have thought of from dishes to silverware , pans , even garbage bags under the sink with dishwasher tabs , 2 different coffee pots (k cup or regular). This house was also beautifully decorated . I would highly recommend this house and Jaclyn as your host !",

We had an issue with getting hot water but Jaclyn responded immediately and resolved the issue. We thought that the house was literally at the base of Holimont but it's actually across the main street and up a road across from the Holimont neighborhood entrance and so you still have to drive to the lodge. That said, it only took a few minutes to get there and just a few minutes longer to get to Holiday Valley so the house was still a great location for skiing. The downtown area is super fun. It's a touch far from the house and the roads aren't very walkable so plan to drive. I highly recommend this house!",

The amenities were top of the line (dishwasher was not noisy, the washing machine was efficient), and easy to use. George was also very attentive to our needs and provided the extra mugs we needed for our group. Do expect that the basement is colder than the rest of the house but this is workable as there are lots of blankets at the basement and the hot water works well. \n\nOverall, it was a lovely stay and we hope we can come back in the future.",
