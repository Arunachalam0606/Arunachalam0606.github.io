The location is great for spending the day in downtown Harpers Ferry, Charlestown, or Shepherdstown, and coming back to enjoy the pool and relax. The house had a bunch of games to play, and the kitchen was stocked with everything you could need. 10 out of 10, loved visiting here and would love to come back again.",

Enjoy an all year indoor pool and fire pit overlooking the Potomac and mountains of three states.\n\nWe're just minutes to great hiking trails as well as wineries, breweries, the casino, boutiques, restaurants, museums, historic sites, rafting, ziplining and much more.\n\n*Please read entire listing details and house rules and discuss any special requests with the owners before booking*",
    "space": "We bought the Blarney Estate during the height of COVID, when working from home became a reality and we were no longer tied down to one specific location. We found the listing online and immediately fell in love with the house and the view. For the next year we worked tirelessly to renovate the estate and make it what you see today. Halfway through this process, after countless visitors, contractors, friends and random strangers told us we ought to turn the house into a BnB, we decided to go for it! \n \nThe house is over 5,000 sqft, with an indoor heated pool and views of the Potomac and mountains from almost every room. The decor and furniture is soft and warm, and our focus is on comfort and refuge.\n\nOur caretakers have chickens, ducks, and turkeys and love to show our younger guests how to feed them, just ask!\n \n1st floor\n----------\n\nLiving room\nThe front door of Blarney leads directly into the foyer with the main stairwell, and to the living room on the left, with a pool table, two large couches and a smart TV. A cabinet full of board games for all ages will keep everyone busy and an oversized window will leave you mesmerized by the beautiful scenic mountains, trees and river.\n \nDining room\nTo the right of the foyer is the large dining room, with an extra large window so you can host your dinner party with an amazing view. \n \nKitchen / Family room\nThe dining room leads to the kitchen and family room with an extra large island, with room for plenty of seating and socializing. The family room has a smart TV, along with a cabinet with toddler toys and drawing materials.  The kitchen is fully stocked with pots, pans, utensils, dinnerware and a coffee station, with complimentary drip and pod coffee, tea, sugars and creamers. Other amenities include a large side by side fridge/freezer, a toaster, air fryer, blender, food processor, sous vide and wine/beer fridge (BYOB). All stainless steel kitchenaid appliances and butcher block countertops. Doing the dishes is slightly more enjoyable with such picturesque views… or so my husband likes to think. \n \nPool Room\nThe pool room has - you guessed it - a pool, which is heated all year round. Enjoy a fun swim or lounge quietly while watching a movie on the 75” TV. Yes, please!  Please read the pool rules thoroughly and don’t hesitate to reach out to the hosts or caretakers if you have questions.\n \n2nd floor\n-----------\n\nThe Grand Suite - One king bed and one queen bed. Views of the river and mountains. Coffee station and smart TV. Ensuite bathroom with double walk in rain showers, jacuzzi tub, a panoramic view and a smart TV. This bathroom is large; you could drag a mattress in this bathroom and sleep on the floor and still have one of the best rooms in the house. This bedroom and the Queen Suite have their own stairwell. The 3rd and 4th bedroom use a different hallway/stairwell.\n \nThe Queen Suite - Two queen beds, one sitting area with a couch and a coffee table. Views of the river and mountains. Coffee station and smart TV. Full bathroom with an extra large tub connected via the hallway with two vanities and a large soaking shower/tub.  This suite and the Grande Suite share a stairwell.\n \nRiver Room - One queen bed and views of the river and mountains. Coffee station and smart TV. Large sliding glass doors leading to the private balcony with seating so you can ditch your party and enjoy a romantic time with views to die for. The River Room and Bunk Room share a stairwell and a full bathroom with a double vanity and shower/tub. \n \nBunk Room - Two extra sturdy bunk beds (rated for adults up to 350lbs), each with their own side table, a coffee station and smart TV. The Bunk Room and the River Room share a stairwell and bathroom with a double vanity and shower/tub. \n \nLaundry room\nThe laundry room has a large capacity washer and dryer with complementary detergent, scented booster beads and dryer balls. There is also an ironing board and a space to hang clothes to dry. \n \nOutdoor space\nThe front of the house has a big open lawn, perfect for playing games and running around. We have rocking chairs on the covered porch overlooking the front yard. \n \nThe side yard has a small playground with two swings and a slide. Play at your own risk, and please no adults on the swings/slide, as it is only rated for up to 150 lbs. In the summer months we have wild raspberries growing behind the playground and are available for all to enjoy.\n \nThe back of the house has a terrace with dining tables, a sitting area and a charcoal grill. The terrace leads to the screened patio with a large, comfy couch, table, fan and swing. The Blarney Tiny House found in the backyard has a number of yard games available to use, just please return them afterwards. Unfortunately, it is not accessible at this time. The backyard also has a fire pit with Adirondack chairs and corn hole boards. The entire backyard overlooks the Potomac River and the Harpers Ferry Gap. Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia are all three visible in one picturesque view.\n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThough we have never seen one at the Blarney Estate, black bears are known to roam the area. This is West Virginia after all, and the house is in a wooded, mountainous area, so expect to be exposed to all things wild: stink bugs, gnats, deer, mice, foxes, snakes, moths, ticks, spiders, bears, oh my!\n\nWe provide complimentary insect spray for outside use. The house has brand new windows with screens, brand new pest resistant insulation, and is regularly treated by pest professionals, and yet you should still inevitably expect to encounter a few bugs inside during your stay. It is almost heaven, after all! \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nGeneral\nHigh speed internet access provided by mesh WiFi throughout the estate. \n \nAll smart TVs have complimentary Netflix, Hulu/ESPN+, Disney+, Curiosity Stream, and Peacock subscriptions in every room.  Additional installed apps include HBO MAX, Apple TV, Prime, and Youtube installed if you have an existing account.\n \nComplimentary toiletries are provided.  Tap water is filtered through a softener, UV, and whole house filter and reverse osmosis water is available in the kitchen.\n \nWe have a portable Bluetooth speaker and microphone in the family room for use by guests who dream of being a super star.\n \nBooks, games and toddler toys are available throughout the house.\n \nAmazon Alexa digital assistant devices are located throughout the house and have Unlimited Music subscriptions, which allow for a variety of fun and useful things you can do, such as:\n\n“Alexa, tell me a joke”\n“Alexa, what’s the weather in Harpers Ferry today?” \n\"Alexa, set an alarm for 5 minutes\"\n\n“Alexa, announce, Lunchtime! Come and get it” - make a house wide message\n“Alexa, play pop music everywhere” - plays pop music throughout the house\n“Alexa, shuffle playlist Skyrim” - plays an owner favorite playlist\n“Alexa, lights off” - will turn off the lights in room or area you are in\n“Alexa, downstairs/upstairs on/off” - will turn on or off all lights downstairs or upstairs\n\nIf you really want to get in the spirit of things, try “Alexa, play Country Roads Everywhere” and enjoy the unofficial West Virginia anthem played throughout the house. At least one member of your party will hate it, but that just makes it even more fun! \n\nAll indoor and outdoor lighting come on every day around dusk and turn off again around dawn. You can also control the lighting via the Alexas and a full list of useful voice control commands is available on a printout in the kitchen.\n\nAlexas can also be disabled before you arrive by the caretakers or unplugged by guests if you wish, but please do not physically move or reprogram them to use your account - they already have unlimited streaming subscriptions tied to them.\n \nAs this is our personal home, and several of us suffer from severe allergies, there are no pets or animals permitted. \n\nWe are not a commercial venue or to be used for hosting business events.\n \nWe have two junior mattresses and a travel cot available per request. There are no beds for the junior mattresses, they would have to go directly on the floor in a bedroom. We offer bottom sheets, but no other bedding for the junior mattresses and travel cot. \n \nShould you find you need something else for your stay, please don’t hesitate to reach out to the hosts or caretakers. If at all possible, we will try to accommodate your requests. Our goal is for you to have everything you need for your stay. \n \nNOTE: Your safety and privacy matters. This property features 3 exterior actively recording cameras, located at the front and side doors and facing the driveway. The cameras do not look into any interior spaces and all Alexa devices can be disabled upon request or unplugged by guests.\n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nA maximum of 14 guests can sleep at Blarney and there is parking for 10-12 cars maximum, depending on size. Please do not park on the grass. \n\nBlarney can not be used to resell business services or as a hosting venue. \n\nUnfortunately, due to capacity and insurance reasons, we cannot accommodate events or weddings.\n\nWhile we understand the desire to get to Blarney as early as possible, we kindly ask, out of respect for the privacy of our guests and staff, that no guests arrive at the property prior to the agreed upon check-in time. If you plan on arriving at Harpers Ferry earlier in the day, we are happy to help with recommendations for restaurants and/or activities to help pass the time. \n\nPool Rules: SAFETY FIRST, please!\n\nNo lifeguard on duty. There MUST be someone over 18 that can swim with minors.\nNo glass of any type inside the pool room, only paper or plastic. Please keep any food and drink to the table area.\nNo diving, running or jumping.\nNo water guns or water squirting toys (due to TV and speakers).\nBabies must wear proper pool diapers such as \"little swimmers\".\nFood is allowed at the table area, but not near or while in the pool.\nNo water balloons in the pool (it clogs the pumps).\nPlease lock the pool room door when not in use for safety.\nThe pool is treated on a regular basis and sometimes the pool is off limits if the water has to be treated. Typically this can take up to an hour.\n\nIf you’re on an extended stay, please understand that our staff needs to access the pool at least once per week to maintain water quality.",
    "access": "Blarney is accessed using keyless entry on the front door. \n\nAs we still call Blarney home when guests are not here, we have to restrict access to a few closets within the house, to accommodate our personal belongings. We have also restricted access to the utility rooms. This way you won’t have to worry about your youngest family members wandering into those areas. Guests will otherwise have access to the entire house. Guests are also free to roam the property, although we ask for some courtesy to be given to the caretakers’ house next door. The large hangar on the property is used for separate business purposes, and is not accessible for guests.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n \nParking\nWe have a long driveway and large parking area that comfortably fits 10 cars. Please do not park on the grass.",

Parking is available for approximately 10-12 cars depending on size and no parking is allowed on the grass. \n\nDue to insurance reasons, no candles or fires of any type are allowed inside.\n\nUnfortunately, due to capacity, zoning, and insurance reasons, we cannot accommodate events or weddings.\n\nBlarney is not a venue and is not to be used as such or to sell business services.\n\nCelebrating a special occasion? Please reach out to discuss options.

We had to make do with the 2 bathrooms and all 12 of us, but it was a fun challenge!  :-)  It was so quiet and peaceful there.  Kids hiked down to the stream a couple of times and played there.  They made use of the bin of outside toys as well.  We enjoyed the wrap-around porch with all its seating.  I personally enjoyed hearing so many different birds and identifying their sounds through my Merlin app!!  We utilized the fire pit twice and enjoyed watching the fireflies each evening.  We gathered there from FL, TN, and WA for our youngest son's wedding near Haper's Ferry.  We certainly couldn't have asked for a better choice and our hosts were spot-on with accommodating our needs and inquiries.  Highly recommend!\n~ Frank & Sally Ruscio, Orlando FL",

We dealt primarily with David, who is a co-host, and he was very attentive and helpful with anything we needed or wanted to know.  We had a hiccup with the AC and David was there immediately to get everything working and keep it that way.  He even delivered us farm-fresh eggs one morning!  \nSuch a unique home and wonderful area - I’d be happy to go back anytime.",

Hosts were Elizabeth’s parents; David and his wife were so good and kind to us. It was perfect farmhouse experience with goats, chickens, ducks, fishes, ponds, bon fire and awesome landscape. Although it was raining most of the time, but we did had fun. My two-year daughter along with other kids thought David was Old MacDonald and they were enjoying moments like petting and feeding animals and birds. \n\nWe thought of cookout but because of weather we had to cook inside, kitchen was well equipped. We had everything we need. David and his wife were awesome hosts. We would like to come back and also recommend this to others.",

    "summary": "Quaker colonial (circa 1753) on small farm with free range goats, chickens, ducks, rabbits, and other animals.  Ballenger farm is close to wineries, breweries, horse and hunt country, the WD&O bike trail, and the Appalachian trail.",
    "space": "The farm is accessed via a private natural road. The property includes a barn, spring house, corn crib, and several streams and ponds. Outside, you can roam the property and visit ducks, chickens, rabbits, and fainting goats; take in the view from the deck;  enjoy the fish ponds (fishing allowed); and walk several trails. Looking to grill? Go back in time with an old fashion fire pit, wood fired grill, and five foot deep in-ground oven.\n\nInside, the vibe is very \"East meets West mid 1700s\" with a mix of classy antiques, funky vintage finds, and East Asian pieces.  In addition to the bathrooms and bedrooms, there is a living room. piano room that looks into the courtyard, dining room that sits up to 12, large kitchen with two ovens and six burner gas cook top, laundry/mud room, and special toy room accessed by a winding stair.",
    "access": "The home includes an original stone section first started in the mid-1700s with a brick section added later. The entire stone section is open to guests, and has it's own private entry. \n\nBallenger Farm is a working hobby farm. We raise chickens, ducks, rabbits, and goats. Feel free to roam the property - there is a mile of trails for walking. However, not all the buildings have been fully restored so they are not safe for adventuring in, especially for children.",
    "notes": "> Ballenger Farm has no check-out Airbnb chores.  Enjoy your stay!\n\n> The goats and other farm animals are friendly and like to investigate new folks. You can toss the chickens and ducks all kinds of snacks and feed the goats out of your hand :).  Please encourage children to move slowly as quick movements can frighten the animals.\n\n> Cars should be parked behind the barns. When cars are parked near the house (which is the goats favorite space) the goats like to play king of the mountain on top of them. \n\n> Stays at Ballenger are limited to eight adults plus several children under 10 years.\n\n> Per Airbnb policy, we do not host parties, events, or other gatherings via the Airbnb platform.\n\n> Please note: my parents live and work on the farm in the brick section that is attached to the main stone house in which you will be staying. There are no shared entrances or indoor spaces. \n\n> Some guests have said that they think that Ballenger has ghosts. We have not seen or heard any. Instead, we think that after 270 years, any house can  be forgiven its quirks and creaks. :)\n\n> Airbnb AI claims that this property is a '10 minute walk from a lake'. There are no lakes of any size in the entire county. Hosts can not change this. Airbnb suggested that I add this note to this listing until they can fix the bug.",
    "neighborhood": "Ballenger Lane is an 18th century natural road with only two other houses and neither are visible from the property giving Ballenger Farm exceptional privacy for the area.\n\nHorse and Hunt Country, the Appalachian Trail, the Shenandoah and Potomac Rivers, Harper's Ferry, and dozens of wineries and breweries are within a 10 to 30 minute radius.\n\nPurcellville is next door. It has quaint shops with vintage goods as well as convenient grocery stores and resturants.\n\nA walking path connects Ballenger Farm to Patrick Henry College. If you have relatives, friends, or business there, it makes it a very quick commute!",
    "transit": "A DC commuter bus departs from a free parking lot 8 minutes away.\n\nDulles Airport is about 30 minutes away.\n\nLyft and Uber are available, but wait times can be a bit longer than in urban areas. Limos are popular for wine tours, but make sure to book in advance.\n\nMetro's Silver Line is 40 minutes away, but opening much closer in 2023.",
    "interaction": "In Covid times you’re able to stay here free of any interaction with me and my cohost parents. You can reach us by phone if you need anything! Also, since the farm is owned by my darling parents you might see us working outside- and we'll probably give a little wave.",
    "house_rules": "Please,  no additional overnight guests. The overnight accommodations are for eight adults/children (additional infants and toddlers that sleep in bassinets or pack n plays are most welcome!).\n\nThe speed limit on Ballenger Lane is 5 mph. It used to be the main North/South road in Western Loudoun back when Ballenger Farm was first established 270 years ago. And now it's in the same condition as it was then! A one lane natural road with washes and pot holes! Please drive carefully and all will be OK.",

The view of the grounds were lovely and we instantly relaxed from our busy lives. James welcomed us upon arrival and showed us around. He even showed me where he has special treats for the miniature donkeys in the pasture right by us. Be warned, it is a tight space and the kitchen has only a 2-burner electric stovetop. But we still had many meals there so it is still doable. James even dropped off a charcoal grill for us to cook the steaks we bought at The Whole Ox (if you know, you know.) Plan on coming again.",

The sunrise was beautiful to watch & we loved exploring to see all the animals located around house. It was a beautiful location in the winter, I can only imagine how lovely it is when everything is in bloom. The house was very clean & fully stocked. They had given lists of things to do/visit in the area which was super helpful. There was plenty of space for our large party. We wished we had stayed there longer! If we ever are in the area again we'd love to stay again. They also have a beautiful event space! if you're looking for the perfect place, this is it! Thank you so much lauren!!",

They also welcome you with a nice bottle of wine and snacks. Make sure you know that, every three days, you will be awakened in the middle of the night with their well equipment, located in the closet with the washer and dryer. If you don't know what it is, you will think that a main waterline burst. It will last until 2:00 in the morning. Hopefully, you will be notified about this... we were not. Also, both tubs and bathroom sinks are very slow in draining. You will be up to your ankles in water while taking a shower. Last, but not least, you are issued one towel, and one washcloth per person.... no extra towels or washcloths and no dishtowels are in the kitchen. No laundry soap but Suji was really sweet and brought over some.",

    "summary": "The Coach Stop offers peace and tranquility for the weary traveler wishing to experience the country life. Located on the west side of Middleburg, the tranquil location offers the country life, but with the convenience of access to Middleburg's attractions. The town of Middleburg and many attractions such as vineyards are only minutes away.",
    "space": "The Coach Stop was built with guest accommodations in mind. All the systems and finishes are new, including independent heating and cooling in every room. Accommodations include four bedrooms, two full bathrooms, a gourmet kitchen, living room, dining room, and patio. All four bedrooms have queen size beds. The bathrooms are centrally located between the four bedrooms, offering maximum convenience for any guest situation.  We pride ourselves in the cleanliness of the environment, and strive to provide simple but elegant accommodations with rural charm.",
    "access": "Guests have full access to the Coach Stop.",
    "notes": "Your Wellbeing is Our Top Priority\n\nCOVID-19 may have affected part of your life, but it doesn’t mean it has to take away from your “home away from home” experience.\n\nWe have always prided ourselves in providing an exceptionally clean environment, and have implemented heightened safety and sanitizing measures, as recommended by the guidance from the world’s leading health authorities, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nThe entire house is always thoroughly disinfected by professional cleaning staff and we also require at least 24 hours between each booking. We clean with environmentally friendly hospital grade cleaners, including every single doorknob and handle.\n\nThe accommodations were designed with comfort in mind, but in a setting that is comparable to hotel accommodations. All our linens are white, guaranteeing cleanliness, floors are a product that can be thoroughly sanitized, carpets are removable and large furniture has covers that are washed after every guest stay. There is also no ductwork in the home, guaranteeing that no airborne infections can occur. Additionally, three air cleaners are utilized in the home as well as dehumidification.\n\nWe also adhere to and exceed AirBNB's advanced cleaning protocols.",
    "neighborhood": "White Hall is situated on Snake Hill Rd, which is a historic gravel byway. Walk to Goodstone Inn, or just enjoy the still very rural western side of Middleburg while exploring Snake Hill Rd and Pothouse Rd. You will often see our horses on the road, being exercised, pulling carriages or doing farm work. Our hunt kennels are also on the property and hounds are walked out daily. The town of Middleburg is only a short drive away (less than 5 miles). Goodstone Inn and other eating establishments are 5-10 minutes away, as well as wineries and other attractions. Whereas other listings advertise “Middleburg”, and are actually in adjacent zip codes, the Coach Stop is actually in the famed 20117 Middleburg Zip Code.",
    "interaction": "White Hall is a working farm where we maintain many of the traditions of Virginia and the Piedmont region. During Hunt season you will often see us Foxhunting from the property, you will also see our driving horses pulling carriages, horses in adjacent fields and other farm activities happening. The Coach Stop is adjacent to our stable yard, so you may have the opportunity to meet and greet the horses and the owners. The Main House and other farm buildings are just down the gravel drive, feel free to reach out with any requests and staff will do their best to accommodate.",

The kitchen is well stocked with everything you need.  The beds and linens were very comfortable.  The bathrooms were very clean and there were plenty of towels for the whole family.  We greatly enjoyed the historical value of the home and appreciated the information left in the information binder.   We enjoyed watching the wildlife from the patio and the front porch.  Deer with their fawns came to visit often, along with a number of birds. Access to the garage was also very convenient.  The hosts haven't missed a thing.  We would definitely return and have already recommended it to some friends and family.  The only thing that was missing was maybe a lounge chair or hammock outside, because it is the perfect place to read a book or take a nap!  Thanks for a perfect stay.",

    "space": "Friendship Farm is conveniently located one hour from Baltimore and Washington DC and 45 minutes from Gettysburg, PA.  Located just minutes from Linganore Winecellars and Black Ankle Vineyards.\n\nEnjoy all that Frederick County has to offer including wineries, distilleries, craft breweries, historic civil war sites as well as biking on the C&O Canal and kayaking the Potomac and Monocacy rivers.  \n\nHistoric downtown Frederick is a 20-minute drive and offers delicious dining, shops and nightlife.  \n\nA stay at Poole House is a unique opportunity to experience a beautifully restored historic house.  The house sits in a private, secluded setting with gorgeous views of 240 acre Friendship Farm.  The stone portion of the house was built in two phases.  The original part of the house was completed before the Revolutionary War and the second stone section was built in 1790.  The restoration and furnishings are true to the period in which the house was built but guests are also provided with modern comforts including wifi, television, central heat and air, heated floors in the kitchen and more.   Bedrooms and bathrooms have fresh new sheets and towels. \n\nGuests have full access to the large, front and side lawns as well as access to the walking trails that run along Linganore Creek and throughout the farm. \n\nPlease keep in mind that this property was built in the 1700s and is not accessible or safe for small children.  There are narrow, winding staircases in the house that we ask you to take caution when using.\n\nA two night minimum stay is required for weekend bookings. \n  \nAn outdoor fire pit and firewood are provided.",

The home and farm were just like the photos and Kay sent easy to follow instructions to get to the property. The unit was spacious and clean, and there were plenty of little extra touches (welcome notes, homemade snacks) that made our stay feel more intimate and personalized. We loved being close to local wineries/vineyards and the views from the porch were just stunning. I'd love to return to the Love Nest again to experience another dose of peace and serenity in the near future.",

The farm and the \"Love Nest\" left us in awe arriving down the hilltop lane. Entering the Nest was amazing and every possible amenites were thoughtfully placed. During three day stay we were finding Kays thoughtful touches, games, ziplock bags, freshed baked cookies and welcoming wine. Each morning and night we found ourselves lingering on the deck with coffee or wine. Extra time at night listening to horses in the field and watching the  last light over the mountains enhanced by a fire element capped every perfect day. Looking forward to a return in fall.

There is a gate at the bottom of your porch so they can’t come and bother you with kisses.\n\tIf you want to go for a hike on the mountain, please go to the end of the driveway walk to the right down the road.

Here’s a small sampling:\n•\tWineries – within three miles you’ll run into (5) wineries.  Within fifteen miles there are (14) of them all around us.

Thompson Wildlife Management Area (4000 acres of hiking and fishing) including part of the Appalachian Trail (1 mile either direction).  Five miles away is Sky Meadows State Park with 22 miles of trails as well as horseback riding trails and fishing.

Later in the evening we heard several, across the trees that skirt part that part of the property. Birdsong filled the air on the next morning, which was sunny and warm; we saw a fox running across the grass in front of the cabin being chased by a crow. A half dozen woodpeckers were drilling in the woods. On our left was undulating pasture land, including some curious goats. On our right behind the cabin was the small chicken coop. Occasionally, one heard a cow from the next property. The ancient cabin has been  nicely renovated while preserving its old character. Atmospheric, rustic yet very comfortable, and a thoughtful touch was a pack of fresh farm eggs in the fridge. If you are over 6ft tall you may  have to bend your neck just a bit; it is a cabin, after all. I am 5'9\" so I was fine.",

We enjoyed sitting outside for morning coffee with the roosters and wine in the evening with the deer. The cabin was so cozy and clean; simply and tastefully furnished. The beautiful tiled shower was big enough for two and had an endless supply of hot water. The king bed was a bit firm but there were plenty of pillows and blankets to make it very comfortable. Mona is a terrific host who answered all of our questions before we booked and provided our check-in instructions so we could arrive at our leisure. The question is always, would you stay again, and my answer is “definitely yes!”",

    "summary": "Our historic Farm is nestled in 700 acres of the Piedmont foothills. Your Farm Stay, in the stunning 1780s Manor home, lets you experience life on a working cattle operation. The home is decorated with period antiques, yet all modern comforts await you. Stroll the gardens, fields & forests. Fish in your private ponds. During your Private Farm Tour we'll meet the Wagyu and 4-wheel to the mountain top to enjoy the incredible views.  Private Wagyu dinner avail. Wineries all around!  Stable avail.",
    "space": "Located on 700 acres in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, our farm is steeped in Virginia history, predating the Civil War. The stunning Manor home, which was built in the late 1700's with additions added in the 1800's and renovated in 2014, has been lovingly and painstakingly preserved.  Although the Farm is the most photographed and painted farm in the County and has been featured in many articles & on garden tours, until now, the home has never offered FarmTour & Stay.   \nTo embrace its historic character, this magnificent home has been decorated with period antiques, yet includes all modern comforts. Each bedroom has its own theme and unique decor - from the Fox Room to the Blue Room.  The Master Bedroom's Turkish rugs and its adjoining master bath decorated with a wall-sized Turkish mosaic, provides a comfortable, quiet place to rejuvenate.  Take tea in the parlor and loosen up your rusty-fingers on the Steinway baby grand.  Relax or jump on the computer in the Reading Room paneled in original cherrywood harvested from the property.  Whether you're sipping a fine Virginia bourbon in the Cherry Room circa 1830, enjoying a gourmet meal on the 16-person dining table circa mid-1700's, or chilling with a movie in the modern basement theatre on comfortable, plush sofas,  you will feel comfortable and immersed  in a history few will ever have the opportunity to experience. \nOnce you're settled in, we'll take you on your Private Farm Tour to see our farm operations,  meet our friendly Wagyu cattle, and 4-wheel to the top of the mountain to talk about the farm and our husbandry practices, while enjoying the most memorable views in the area. \nAfter the tour, you're off to explore.  Right in your backyard is the stone house where George Washington passed thru while surveying nearby land in 1769. You may prefer to fish in the 6 ponds on the property that await your prize-winning catch (& release) or hike through the vast pastures & forests. For the cowfolks, join us to feed the cattle and tend to the barn animals. Come evening, enjoy the beautiful outdoor terrace with a glass of local Virginia wine while watching the sunset over the Blue Ridge mountains.  Weather & season permitting, the full-size pool, cabana, bathhouse, basketball courts, and gourmet outdoor kitchen with Italian brick oven is available for your use.\nThe home's six bedrooms and 6.5 bathrooms  accommodates several couples or a large family easily.  \nThe Farm is close to Great Meadows for the Gold Cup, restaurants and shopping in Upperville, Marshall, and Middleburg, endless hiking trails, including the Appalachian Trail, and more wineries than you could visit in a week. During your Farm Stay, we can arrange a Private Gourmet Wagyu Dinner with one of our Resident Chefs.  You may never want to leave and we'll count the days 'til your return! \nNote: In order to ensure your safety and that of our animals, only the guests on your registered Farm Stay may stay and/or enjoy the amenities on the Farm during your Farm Stay.",

    "neighborhood": "Farms, wineries, forests... it doesn't get any better.",
    "interaction": "We will receive our guests when they arrive to show them around,  look over the rules and accessible areas, and confirm the scheduled Farm Tour.  Guests are welcome to spend time feeding with us on the morning after their arrival and will have lots of opportunities to enjoy a bunch or a little of Life on The Farm Stay.  We will be available and working on-site during your stay, so please reach out when you have any questions.",
    "house_rules": "This property is an actual farm.  There will be farm operations going on as daily operations. During your Private Farm Tour, we will ask that you complete our Agritourism waiver form, available ahead of time by email.  \nATTENTION:  Under Virginia law, there is no liability for an injury to or death of a participant in an agritourism activity conducted at this agritourism location if such injury or death results from the inherent risks of the agritourism activity. Inherent risks of agritourism activities include, among others, risks of injury inherent to land, equipment, and animals, as well as the potential for you to act in a negligent manner that may contribute to your injury or death.

  "description": {
    "summary": "Welcome to Doah House, your sanctuary nestled on a bluff atop Blue Mountain, just 30 min from Shenandoah National Park. This Scandinavian cabin on a private 4-acre retreat provides unforgettable views and wildlife. Unwind in a wood-fired hot tub, by a cozy fire, or explore nearby trails and wineries. Perfect for rest, rejuvenation, and reconnection.",
    "space": "Disconnect to reconnect with nature and yourself at this unforgettable escape.\n\nA few things we love:\n• Soak in your private wood fired hot tub amongst the trees\n• Step out of bed onto the deck. The hidden sleeping area features a queen bed and sliding glass doors, making it easy to wake up with nature\n• Tuck away in the upstairs loft where a comfy queen bed and secret lookout window create the classic forest hideout experience⁠\n• The spa-like bathroom features a rain shower, heated moroccan tile floors, and a floor to ceiling window to soak in the morning light\n• Stretch out by the  fireplace as the sun sets, enjoying the surrounding mountain view from an expansive 16’ of sliding glass doors\n• Prepare meals in the well-stocked kitchen with high end cookware, new appliances and heated kitchen floors (and perhaps a bottle of wine from a nearby vineyard)\n• Practice yoga or enjoy a picnic on the expansive wrap-around outdoor deck\n• Sit around the outdoor solo stove fire pit\n• Disconnect with curated board games and books in your own  private library\n• Enjoy the surrounding state parks, award-winning wineries, and top rated restaurants\n• Hike the nearby Appalachian Trail\n• Option to get groceries and take-out delivered on-demand\n• Watch the wildlife: Foxes, woodpeckers, and hawks are common visitors\n• Browse with blazing fast internet",
    "access": "The only way to get mountain top views is to get to the top of the mountain. \n• Expect at least 10 minutes on a long, unpaved, sometimes bumpy 1 mile gravel road\n• A few steep sections require caution\n• The road is routinely and professionally maintained by the county, especially during severe weather\n• However, from November to April, we strongly advise that you use a four-wheel drive (4WD) or all-wheel drive (AWD) vehicle\n• While there are plenty of dry weekends during those months where a regular vehicle would be fine, you cannot know that in advance. \n• The rest of the year, regular 2WD vehicles (front or rear) are fine. Even vehicles with below-average ground clearances like VW GTIs and Volvo C30s have had no problems. \n• We provide a level parking spot for 2 vehicles",
    "notes": "By completing this online reservation you are confirming that you read and agreed to the guide and rules. \n\nBugs\nBeing in the woods means there is a chance for bugs in and outside the property. However, an exterminator routinely treats the area around the house to reduce the chance of guests meeting unwelcome guests. \n\nChildren\nThe house is child friendly, but not child proofed. Please watch your kids.\n \nTrash\nKeep all trash inside the house to avoid unexpected encounters with wild animals, like bears, foxes, raccoons, etc.\n\nWeather\nIn the winter, please check the weather before you go so that if you do get snowed in, you are covered with the necessities.\n\nHeating\nThe wood stove is the most effective way to heat when temps drop below freezing, but supplemental heating sources include a mini split heat pump, radiant floor heating and a plug-in electric heater.",
    "neighborhood": "Private and secluded. Within short driving distance to Shenandoah National Park, the Appalachian Trail, and excellent wineries and restaurants.",
    "transit": "Please note that due to the mountain drive, it takes around 30 minutes to get into towns like Front Royal or Winchester. Feel free to walk the neighborhood but for more scenic hikes, we recommend specific ones that are best reached by car, e.g. Appalachian Trail (20 min), Sky Meadows (23 min) and others.",
    "interaction": "Available via text or phone",
    "house_rules": "Dog-Friendly Stay: We welcome well-behaved, house-trained dogs. We kindly request you keep your furry friends off the furniture and ensure they're accompanied at all times. Please note, dogs are not allowed to sleep on the beds.\n\nWinter Rescheduling Assurance: For stays between December and March, rest assured that if inclement weather, such as snow or ice, prevents access to the property, we will gladly assist you in rescheduling or provide a refund.\n\nHot Tub Enjoyment: Our hot tub is here for your enjoyment. Please ensure your safety by using it responsibly.\n\nGuest Count Policy: Please note, the property comfortably accommodates up to 4 guests. Additional guests will incur a charge of $50 per person per night. To ensure a pleasant stay for all, we may need to terminate your stay without a refund if the maximum occupancy is exceeded.\n\nSafety First: To ensure your safety and prevent potential fire hazards, we kindly request no candles in the property. \n\nWildlife Respect: To keep our local wildlife safe and to avoid any surprise encounters, please help us by keeping all trash inside the house.",

Simple living, long weekend with no TV, just great view of the Potomac, nice walk in Shepherdstown and along the Canal, dinner at Blue Moon! Caught no fish but had fun canoeing up the river and floating back down. It was a good idea to have that stairway down to the river... very helpful!  Almost lost my shoes in the silt beds on the shoreline but figured how to work around  it.  thanks Yo !",

The air conditioning was a nice touch, as well as, the air purifier. I would recommend adding a couple sharp knives or bringing your own along. We cooked out on the grill supplied and made steaks and they were a little tough to cut with the butter knives. There was some tea, coffee, spices and oils to cook with. We left behind some spices and microwaveable popcorn for the next guests. My only negative comment about the location is it was listed as “secluded.” I went outside to take a shower and as I was walking back to the house I could see the hosts in their yard next door. So, if I can see you then you can see me and that is not secluded to me. So, I felt that part was a bit misleading in the description of the property. Otherwise, it’s a quiet place with beautiful views and a lovely little town to visit and explore.",

    "summary": "Relax and escape to the peace and quiet by the Potomac river, and wake to beautiful romantic views of the river and mountains, in this romantic 200 square foot tiny house situated on 2.5 acres, 450 feet of river front land.  Explore and partake of all the activities on the river and surrounding area, just 1 mile from Shepherdstown.  Fish, bike, kayak, tube, or just sit by the river and watch the birds and wild life.  Read by the river or in the quiet comfort of the house, w/ some wine on us.",
    "space": "This is a 1940s refurbished fisherman's cabin.  It was likely built in or about 1942 as the original electric fixtures are from that date, we had to modernize them though as they don't meet current code.   It is very likely that the structure was built to replace an older wooden structure in the same location.   There is electricity but no running water, water dispenser is provided. \nNOTE that the bathroom is a pit outhouse located nearby.\n\nOn the west side of the 200square foot room, you will find a comfortable Queen sized bed with CertiPUR foam mattress and lots of pillows.  There are several blankets.   At the foot is a WWII mail crate restored and converted to a trunk that was found in the tiny house, used to store extra linens and blankets.   Above the headboard is a fantastic decorative shelf made from river maple that fell by the river in front of the building.   Right in front of the bed is a window affording great views of the river.\n\nOn the east side of the building is the sitting area with kitchen cabinets.    The counter is made from old reclaimed barn door complete with the clasp.   The shelves above are from the from of the barn door complete with hinges.   Equipped with utensils, a microwave, dorm fridge, and crock water dispenser.   A table for two in front of another river facing window.\n\nOutside is a small porch with two comfortable chairs and BBQ, that has a commanding view of the river.   The cabin and this sitting area are nestled back into the wooded hillside loved by a plethora of songbirds and woodpeckers.  \nTo the East of the porch is a small three seasons outdoor shower and sink.  The shower is fed by cold water but has a 5.5 gallon solar warming tank attached (it is in tree shade so the showers will be cold).  NOTE that we will be shutting off the outdoor shower before the first frost and back on after last frost.\n\nHome sits on 2.5 acres adjacent to the Potomac river with C&O national historical park across the river.  This section of the river is usually shallow and often can be walked across, near Packhorse Ford.   Between the property and Shepherdstown is the historic battlefield of Shepherdstown with walking path and markers.\n\nNestled to the other side of the tiny house is the very clean and comfortable pit toilet (out house).   It is in the original location but all rebuilt with modern seat and plenty of privacy, well vented and stocked with hand sanitizer.",
    "access": "Full access to all living spaces, parking area, all yard areas.\nThe river front and fire pit are shared areas with the Stone River house.\n\nHouse includes:\nFree WiFi, but no TV\nheat\nbedding\nmicrowave\nBBQ and porch with a view\nthree season outdoor shower",
    "notes": "If you love nature or history, there are great many things to see and do in and around Shepherdstown, including hiking, kayaking on the Shenandoah and Potomac rivers, fish in the rivers, tour historic Shepherdstown, Harpers ferry, Sharpsburg, Antietam battlefield. Enjoy several local fantastic restaurants.",
    "neighborhood": "The home is a short bike ride or drive to historic downtown Shepherdstown. You will go by some historic ruins and Shepherdstown Battlefield, on the way by Packhorse Ford.   \nClose to NCTC, Antietam, C&O canal and Harpers Ferry.",
    "transit": "The home is a short bike, kayak, or drive to historic Shepherdstown.  You can view the battlefield of Shepherdstown and old cement/grist mill ruins on the way.\nHarpers Ferry, NCTC, and Antietam battlefield are short drives away.\n\nMany guests have enjoyed renting bikes in town and riding on the C&O canal towpath. Contact Pedal and Paddle for more info on outdoor activities.",
    "interaction": "This is a private self-serve house. Owner will be available, via cell phone, for check in and check out, and any questions. Otherwise this space is yours to enjoy.",
    "house_rules": "This house does not have a shower and the restroom is a pit toilet ( out house ),\nPlease no trash or feminine hygiene products in the pit.\nThis cabin is nestled in the woods so there will be wild life and insects around the property.

We fell in love with our 1 1/2 acre property right in the heart of historic Harper’s Ferry and wanted to do something with the land besides building houses on it, so we started our lavender farm four years ago. We really love hiking, biking on the towpath, and walking in town. \n\nWhen Covid 19 hit, we temporarily changed our focus from art shows to hosting on our small lavender farm. It has been such a success and pleasure, that we just opened our sister property down the street! \n\nThe Trouvaille House was built in 1837 and we updated it to create four luxury suites! A trouvaille is a treasure or lucky find, and we certainly feel that way about it.\n\n We have a welcoming committee at La Soledad waiting to greet you! Busta and Blu are two energetic, goofy puppies that play outside daily. Romeo is our very friendly cat that keeps an eye on them!",

From the charm of the lavender, to the friendliness of the two sweet dogs who may greet you, to the peaceful view  - it was a warm welcome. Christie is a gracious and thoughtful host who showed me the apartment layout and shared personalized suggestions for where to eat, hike, and meander while in Harper’s Ferry. She has thought of everything to make one feel comfortably at home and the space itself is inviting and well designed. I intended a peaceful getaway from the noise and pace of DC and I received that and more. Highly recommend this charming stay.",

Huge game room downstairs with shuffleboard, arcade games, nintendo, skee ball, etc, plus a pool table and ping pong table outside, as well as frisbee golf \"holes\" and a cornhole set. Bedrooms all had great bathrooms. Kitchen was massive and great for prepping big meals.\n\nBeyond the house, it's only a few minutes walk on a beautiful gravel road to the well-marked and manicured trails on Sugarloaf. There's a great winery about a five minute drive away. We did a float trip on the Monacacy for half a day. And there's Frederick, MD about 20 minutes by car with a fun downtown.\n\nGreat stay!",

The tournament didn’t go so well but the house and all it offered saved the trip. Our 16 year old boys had plenty of room in the bunk house and more than they could handle in the game room.  Highlight was a father son shuffleboard tournament that went well into the night. The room upstairs are super comfortable and spacious. We were able to cook multiple meals in the excellent kitchen and enjoy our dinners on the deck overlooking the woods. The house is surrounded by trails, so whether it’s running or hiking, there are plenty of miles to get your steps in. I highly recommend this house and would certainly return.",

We spent a lot of time in DC but knew we wanted a place to relax at after walking around with 3 children for most of the day. This was just the place!  Our 13 year old loved the variety of instruments to play (and it kept him off his phone!). Our 11 year old connected with the chickens and goats-feeding them and watching them roam freely. Our 5 year old loves all of the beautiful artwork and quickly made his own. My husband and I loved the quiet walks and peaceful surroundings. Thank you so much!",

    "summary": "Easily escape to the woods on a 14 acre homestead that's only 20 miles from DC. \n\nSurrounded by the forest with amazing views, designed by artists, this secluded hideaway is a celebration of Nature and Art.\n\nRecharge amongst these ancient trees and all the singing critters that soundtrack the night. \n\nEnjoy a fire, frolic in the fields, read on a hammock, strum a guitar, and feel the pressure of modern life melt away. \n\nExplore the many bucolic trails nearby.\n\nPerfect for retreats and workshops.",
    "space": "A woodsy home that's equal parts log cabin and modernist architecture. A working collage of creative approaches to home decor. Ultimately the feel is warm and pure Bohemia, from the unique art, antiques, plants, and lighting, to the musical instruments and the soul nourishing books throughout. \n\nThis space is everything you thought you'd have to travel the world to find.",
    "access": "Guests get the entire house and surrounding areas to themselves with freedom to explore everywhere else.\n\nWe visit the fields during the day to check on the animals and the garden. We’re also in the neighborhood if you have special needs during your stay.\n\nThe property has many areas: gardens, chicken coups, hammocks, ponds, creeks, fire circles, and glamping structures in the woods. \n\nYou may enjoy all of them.",
    "notes": "Please inform us if you have dogs. We are supportive of dog-owners but have had bad experiences in the past with dogs terrorizing our animals. Please only bring your dogs if you are confident in their docility. If you are not sure, we can keep our chickens locked up.\n\n\n*Want to have a small wedding here?? We had a fully outdoor wedding here this year and would love to help you with yours. We actually offer a small wedding package that includes flowers, tents, tables, chairs, and a really exceptional ordained officiant. Our weddings are for couples that are madly in love and feel overwhelmed by the wedding industry. Our approach celebrates the sacredness of the union and avoids whatever can be avoided about modern weddings. Our pricing reflects this simple heart-of-the-matter approach so reach out if you're curious and like the way we do things around here. :)",
    "neighborhood": "Dirt roads and endless woods with river access nearby. \n\nShops and civilization are a 10-15 minute drive from the farm. \n\nSeveral  bucolic places to take long walks.",
    "interaction": "We are in the neighborhood and available for support during your stay. \nNo parties or extra guests without prior approval.  It's important to us that everyone here treats the land and animals with respect and uses their time here to connect with Nature.",
    "house_rules": "NO EXTRA PEOPLE without prior approval. We will find out and keep your security deposit if you try to have a party here.",

Due to a storm that came thru the internet went out. But we told Dustin and he did what he could try and fix it and offered a credit to compensate for the outage.

    "summary": "Nestled along the Blue Ridge Mountains, LoeLynn Farms is the quiet escape you need. The two story cottage offers two car parking next to the front door, a fully equipped kitchen, outdoor living, lake access and most importantly- peace and relaxation. The Cottage is conveniently located to many wineries, breweries, exceptional restaurants and outdoor adventures. We are just 90 minutes outside of Washington, D.C. in the heart of Loudoun County Wine Country.",
    "space": "The cozy Queen bed and full bright bathroom are located on the upper level of the cottage overlooking the grounds.  ﻿Stay in for board games and movies, or head out for a hiking adventure or vineyard tour.  Make it a grill-at-home night, or enjoy a meal at one of our favorite farm-to-table restaurants for delicious food and wine.  Take one of our kayaks out, or bring your fishing rod to our private lake stocked full of various types of fish.  Be sure to visit one of the 50 award-winning wineries or over 30 craft breweries in the area while you are here.  Whatever your preference, you are sure to find something to enjoy.﻿",
    "access": "You will have full access to the Guest House and the field behind the Guest House, which features some short trails around our Silo and up to the barn.  We also allow our guests to wander our farm, and our only ask is that you respect our privacy and don't wander onto \"our\" side of the farm.  We can provide a map upon request of the grounds if you are interested in exploring.",
    "notes": "We welcome you to bring your own fishing gear to use on the lake. Please let us know in advance!\n\nThe home is most ideal for two adults. While we have not specifically set up the space for a small child traveler, you are welcome to bring them with your own pack-n-play and necessities.  Also, small, potty-trained animals are welcome.\n\nNote, LoeLynn Farms is an old Farm that was built in 1910 and has gone through a number of hands, some of which neglected sections of the farm until we came to acquire it in 2020.  The majority of your payment helps us restore our farm back to its natural beauty.  However, areas of the farm are in much-needed repair.  Our only ask is that you respect the farm and the old structures, and do not attempt to climb on or scale the structures around the farm.",
    "neighborhood": "LoeLynn Farms is located in rural Loudoun County, just along the Maryland border. You'll enjoy quiet, fresh air and plenty of stars. You will need a vehicle to get around this part of Loudoun County. We are a short distance from the Potomac River, C&O Canal Towpath, Dulles airport, the MARC train and plenty of historic towns, including Harper's Ferry, WV and Frederick, MD. There really is SO much to do- check out our guidebook for ideas!",
    "transit": "You'll need a car to get around this area. Most sites and businesses have plenty of free parking.",
    "interaction": "The Cottage is completely yours when you stay with us- no sharing required! We live across the yard in the main house. Enjoy self check in, and if you need anything, we'll be around!",
    "house_rules": "Be mindful of noise after 10 PM.\n\nThe First Aid Kit is located in the drawer of the bathroom vanity.\n\nSmoke Detector/Carbon Monoxide Detectors are located in the bedroom and in the Kitchen.\n\nFire Extinguisher is located under the kitchen sink.\n\nThe light switch to the left of the entrance door has two switches on it. The switch on the left controls the outlet that is hooked up to the router, so if you turn that switch off, it will turn off the wifi.\n\nWe kindly ask that you not wander onto the main house's yard/porch area, as we do have dogs who like to jump on strangers.  \n\nYou're more than welcome to check out the red and stone barn on the property, but for your safety, please do not go into the other outbuildings. \n\nDo not attempt to climb the silo.\n\nDuring your wanderings, you may see black garden snakes and other critters that are friendly/skittish and will most likely just run if they see you. While we have not seen any copperheads/rattlesnakes, our neighbors have and they are common to the area and are more aggressive, so if you see one, do not try to pick it up.\n\nIf you want to use our Kayaks, please reach out so we can have you sign our Waiver form to do so.\n\nThanks, and enjoy!",

The bathroom was actually bigger that I thought it would be, going from the picture. The shower is nice and spacious.  The little deck is cute. Weather didn't allow us to sit out at night, but we did sit inside in the comfy chairs and could still enjoy the sound of the fountain and the drizzling rain through the screen door. I have chronic back troubles and the mattress did very well for me. I slept great. \nOverall, a very lovely, peaceful place to stay.",

The property was beautiful … a cozy, intimate, and gorgeously designed guesthouse built onto the historic original springhouse, (dating back to the 1790s), with a private balcony overlooking the pond and lovely grounds.  Even their gorgeous pups, Norma and Russell, were so friendly.  My boyfriend and I wish we could have stayed longer. Don’t hesitate to book your stay! I cannot recommend this Airbnb highly enough … such a special place! \nGretchen & Chris, July 2023",

    "summary": "Feel refreshed when you stay in this rustic gem!  The Springhouse is nestled in the rolling hills of Northern Virginia’s Wine Country! \n\nOriginally constructed in the early 1800's, this structure was built over a natural spring and used for refrigeration.  The water from the spring maintains a constant cool temperature throughout the year while also filling a pond.  The original stone well, channel and stone flooring are all intact for guests to explore and experience how our ancestors lived.",
    "space": "This newly renovated building has been designed with a living unit.  Enter into a 2 story atrium and up the stairs into a cozy living space.\nUpon entering is a  kitchenette equipped with a microwave and compact refrigerator.  Across the hall is a full bath with walk-in shower.\nThe main living space has a queen bed, dresser, with television above.  A pair of club chairs invite guests to relax and enjoy the view overlooking the pond.",
    "access": "Parking is off the street.  We will direct the guests on the path to follow toward the pond.\n\nGuests have access to the whole property.  Our stone patio is available for guests to have their morning coffee or enjoy a bottle of wine from one of our local wineries while watching the sunset.  A fire pit is also available upon request.",

The ground were meticulously kept and the flowers and greenery were always a lovely sight. We definitely hope to return soon and enjoy other seasons in the area.",

  "description": {
    "summary": "The Cottage at Firefly Cellars is a private, tranquil escape on the tasting room property. Come enjoy the private pool (in summer months), walk the property  with a glass of wine, enjoy views of the neighboring horses,  hop to local wineries, or just sit back and enjoy all the cottage has to offer. The cottage is meticulously maintained, beautifully designed, and you will feel at home the  moment you walk through the doors. Perfect for a couple, or an individual looking to escape from busy life!",
    "space": "IMPORTANT: The tasting room is open Thursday-Sunday from the months of April-October, and Friday-Sunday in the colder months. If you are visiting on a day that the winery is closed and would like to buy wine to enjoy at the cottage, just let me know!\n\nThe Cottage is tucked away in a private space on the property, and guests will enjoy privacy throughout their stay. Guests will also enjoy the views from the adjacent horse farm. \n\nThe great room boasts 18’ ceilings, and is attached to the modern, open concept kitchen and eating area. The bedroom includes one queen sized bed, and the bathroom comes stocked with towels and linens. The kitchen is equipped with coffee maker, cups, dishes, glassware, silverware, microwave, oven, blender, and a mini and full sized refrigerator (full size located in closet).\n\nThe bedroom and bathroom are on the main floor. The curved staircase leads to an upstairs loft with a couch and bookshelves. \n\nIn front of the cottage, you will find a table for two that overlooks the pool, perfect for decompressing at the end of the day or to enjoy an outdoor meal. \n\nThe pool is open from late May-September and is only for Airbnb guest use. A private hot tub and firepit are there and ready for guest use year round. Note about the hot tub- there are trees all over the property. It is possible that leaves may make their way into the hot tub when the lid is off. Hot tub is maintained by a company who cleans/maintains chemical levels/etc to ensure the best quality. There is a chance they will arrive during your stay, but it is a very quick visit and will be on their way shortly (their usual days of service are Mondays and Fridays). There is also a pool maintenance company that comes twice a week (Mondays and Fridays, unless extreme weather. If there is heavy rain, they may come on a different day) for a quick clean and chemical level check. A brand new hot tub unit was put outside the Cottage in May 2022, on the front porch. Its covered, so still able to use on cozy rainy evenings! \n\nThe cottage is tucked away on a private corner of the property, so you will not have interaction on anyone else who may be on the property at the tasting room or the barn, unless you come spend some time with us at the tasting room! The pool/hot tub/firepit are for Airbnb guests only, not shared amenities.\n\nThe firepit is located outside of the cottage, and firewood and fire starters are provided. \n\nThere is a table with two chairs on the front porch, perfect spot for drinking your morning coffee, reading a book, or enjoying a glass of wine in the evening! \n\nNo one is allowed in the cottage except for the 1-2 guests staying there. Visitors are NOT permitted allowed during your stay.\n\nIMPORTANT: If visiting during the summer months, you will be required to sign a pool liability waiver before visiting. Please send your email address when booking.",
    "access": "Guests have access to the Cottage, private use of the hot tub and the pool (in the warmer months), and their own parking spot. Guests are able (and encouraged!!) to walk over to the tasting room once it opens in the spring to have a glass (or 3) of wine with us before heading back to enjoy the cottage for the evening.",
    "notes": "Please keep in mind that this cottage is on a winery/tasting room property. While the cottage is quiet and private, there is a chance you may hear cars coming and going from the tasting room or other events happening on the property.\n\nThis listing is NOT a child friendly rental. \n\nIf you are at the property on a Thursday or Friday morning in the spring and summer months, you will hear landscaping vehicles around the property. They mow on these mornings (Thursday OR Friday, not both), so you will hear some noise for a few minutes around the cottage. \n\nThere is an alarm system in the Cottage. This is NOT for guest use. Please do not arm the Cottage during your stay- this system is for days the Cottage is unoccupied and only for Firefly Cellars staff use. \n\nDoordash/Grubhub deliver to the Cottage and you have a large variety of places to choose from. So if you are planning on just ordering and food and not leaving the Cottage, you are set! \n\nThe TV is not a smart TV. There is cable access (Xfinity) and you can stream from a laptop or phone if you bring an HDMI cord.\n\nPLEASE READ: Feeding the horses is NOT PERMITTED. The horses belong to our neighbors, and while they are friendly and lovely to look at, they have allergies and cannot be fed. \n\nThis property is located in nature, therefore you may experience nature elements such as deer, snakes, or other animals. \n\nIf there is anything during your stay that needs attention or would affect your 5 star rating, please let us know! We are committed to making your stay as pleasant as possible, and we will respond to your message within the hour.",
    "neighborhood": "The Cottage at Firefly Cellars is located in Western Loudoun County, within close proximity to more than 20 surrounding wineries and breweries. We are a short, ten minute drive from both downtown Leesburg and Purcellville, providing many options for dining out and entertainment. Guests will also be close to several walking/hiking trails where you can enjoy all of the beautiful scenery that Loudoun County has to offer. We are 45 miles from Washington DC, and a quick ten minute drive to the toll road for easy access into the city. We are also directly next door to a horse farm that offers trail rides, a nice addition to your getaway!",
    "transit": "The Cottage is a 20 minute drive from Dulles Airport, a ten minute drive to the toll road, and one mile off of route 7.",
    "interaction": "During your stay, I prefer to keep my distance to give you privacy. The cottage is meticulously maintained and fully stocked, and should not have any issues.

It’s located right on the winery property, so it’s easy to visit the tasting room. It’s also right next to the brewery, so it’s a very easy trip over there and to the market as well. The place was extremely clean, well maintained, and so peaceful. We immediately fell in love with it. The fridge was stocked with some fresh strawberries, granola, beverages and fresh apple cider donuts- which were incredible!! The listing does mention that the property is right in the middle of the “you-pick” cherries, but we didn’t realize just how close to the windows people would be. We just left the property until the “you-pick” hours were over; so simple fix. There wasn’t anything negative about this experience. We can’t wait to visit again in the future. Highly, highly recommend.",

    "summary": "The Grotos Grove is a destination by itself and serves a very convenient base of operations to experience the regions many activities/events with Blue Valley and Barrel Oak Vineyards only ¼ mile away.   The house was completely restored in 2017 with large modern kitchen, and 3 full baths and 2 half baths;  2 master bedrooms, 2 bedrooms and a loft. One of Washington's top interior decorators furnished the home specifically with the idea of group/family use while maintaining its historic charm.",
    "space": "        The Grove is located in Delaplane where John Marshall, the former United States Supreme Court Chief Justice who grew up at Oak Hill Mansion next door. The Grove was actually built by John Marshall for his sister.  The town of Marshall (just five minutes away) is named after the former Chief Justice. The historic and popular towns of Middleburg, Warrenton, Paris and Upperville are all easy 15-20 minute drives.   The Grove can truly be your home away from home with all the comforts and quality, no more hotels who are regular visitors to the area!\n\n        Please note that the Grove is located near I66 traffic can be heard.  The house is quiet with it's stone walls.  The positive is that you are just off the service road and fast travel to the vineyards and town of Marshall and great for cyclists as you are immediately along one of popular  routes according to Potomac Pedalers.\n\n         Fauquier County is among the finest horse country in Virginia. Some of the most beautiful farms in the county are nearby. The Orange County hunt, sometimes comes in sight of the town when hunting foxes. It is not uncommon to see horse trailers and vans parked on Main Street of Marshall. Hounds and horses abound in this area.  However it is also a great place for writers, actors politicians and other well known people to live quietly and anonymously.   As a result, there are many new restaurants and local butcher’s, bakers and markets establishments to enjoy year round.\n\n      In addition the home sits on 10 private acres to include a nice hiking/running trail around the perimeter.  The kitchen and the dinning area are designed for great gatherings and there’s a nice patio out the side to enjoy the agricultural setting of the area and boasts a nice fire pit.  The large high ceiling living room is perfect for events such as private recitals, acting and story telling and yes even watching sporting events on TV.  The famous round room offers another quite place for discussion and reading. The game room underneath provides indoor activities for all ages.  The internet café/wine tasting room provides a setting to enjoy all the samples of the nearby vineyards (Barrel Oak and Blue Valley actually within walking distance – but not recommended) to conduct your own tasting.\n\n         The Grove is located in one of the prettiest and popular cycling areas you will find in the Northern region of Virginia.   Consequently, the County hosts many cycling events from the Spring to the Fall.  These popular rides pass by the grand estates and orchards of Virginia's Hunt Country, and following the spine of the \"mysterious\" Mount Weather and down along the bottom of the ridge line of the Appalachian Trail.  The Grove is located just off RT55 which is part of all the key rides so you don’t have to drive and park just get on your bike and GO!  - And for those you like to hike, Sky Meadows State Park offers great scenic hiking trails that connect with the Appalachian Trail. ",

We felt right at home. We enjoyed a day at the pool and her precious dog Baxter hung out with us. He was adorable and wonderful company! Lynn was very kind and asked if we needed anything and offered to take us to see the horses on the property. She had an awesome guidebook with all kinds of recommendations. We found super fun things to do, like shop in Leesburg, and tried several of the restaurants she suggested. Overall best weekend! Would definitely recommend this Airbnb to anyone looking for a relaxing weekend away and we hope to go back soon!",

Front Royal has quite a few restaurants and is about 20 mins away from the airbnb,which made it easy to go eat at the restaurants. The park entrance too is about 25 mins away which made it easy for out to go and do some hikes. Jenny was extremely responsive, I didn’t have many questions for her, but when I did, she replied very fast. I would not hesitate to recommend her place to others. It even had a table tennis table which could be converted to a pool table and they had all the equipment for both sports. The two giant tv’s in the living room and family room were great as after a day out hiking in sweltering heat, it was a nice to come back to the Airbnb and veg out in front of the tv\n Thank you for a wonderful stay!",

    "summary": "Escape from it all! Private, newly-renovated retreat at end of dead end road. One of a kind home surrounded by nature, an aging tennis court, salt water pool (seasonal) + built-in spa (year round). Air tight - warm & cozy in winter!\n\nInviting main level with eat-in kitchen and garden views. Queen murphy bed and tiled bath with safety handles allows for one-floor living, if desired.\n\nLoft features a king bed, day bed with trundle and desk. No parties or loud noise outside. See below for pool use.",
    "space": "Private drive at end of dirt road leads to a newly-renovated two level barn. The open main level living area offers lovely sun all day and includes sitting area, eat-in kitchen and tiled bathroom. Cozy 2nd floor loft with king bed, twin daybed with pull-out twin trundle and a work desk with chair.\n\nThe barn is tucked against the woods, with fruit trees and a sprawling meadow out your front door. A short walk past raised vegetable beds leads to a stone pavilion with table and seating for 6, a fenced-in, unheated pool (open May 10 - Oct 23, 2023) with built-in spa pool and an aging (but playable) tennis court with basketball hoop. South-facing views from the hilltop offer expansive treetop views, all-day sun and gorgeous sunsets. Charcoal grill and solo stove / fire pit area near front patio of barn.\n\nExtremely private setting on seven acres. The barn sits on hill above main house, which is barely visible from the upper part of the property.\n\nKitchen offers 2 under counter refrigerators and a freezer, 2-burner electric stovetop, toaster oven capable of cooking a 10\" pizza, stove top espresso maker and french press coffee maker. Dishware and cooking supplies included. Inquire for specifics.\n\nPool, spa pool and tennis court are shared only with the owners (if we are there) from 10-7pm. These areas are for the exclusive use of guests all other hours.  For exclusive use of these areas from 10-7pm, we charge $100 per day, to be arranged in advance. Please inquire for more details or to discuss specific arrangements. \n\nProvided: tennis and pickleball equipment, basketball, badminton, charcoal for grill and firewood for the solo stove.

There is a lot of natural light coming into the place which was nice to wake up to. We really loved how slow paced the environment felt as we wanted to get away from the fast pace city living. We  couldn’t have ask for a more comforting and relaxing stay. Stephanie was super responsive and always made sure we had everything we needed. We most definitely will be staying here again!",

I treat travel no different.  When traveling, I know what makes me happy ~ clean , comfy accommodations, plush beds, soft linens & towels, WI FI, cable, tasteful décor, well appointed kitchens, etc  and as a host I aim to offer no less and WOW my guests.  In my spare time, I am an avid boater spending time on the Chesapeake Bay in MD and in FL on the Gulf or in the Keys.  Saltwater is my soul food.    Beach, bay, mountains, trails, small towns  ~ you name it ~ I like it! I also appreciate antiques,  fine wine and breweries, good food ranging from the Cracker Barrel  to fine dining, farmers markets,  fairs and festivals, gardening, a cozy fire and a good book, a Jeep ride on country back roads, and last but not least quality time with family and friends.  I love my career and feel blessed with  the journey it has taken me on and the doors of opportunity it has opened.  I believe in “supporting local” every chance I get.   “Living  life to the fullest” every day is my motto. What can I say ~ “Life is good...” !  I look forward to hosting you at any one or ALL of my four unique, private short term rentals and I am happy to offer area recommendations for your stay ranging from activities to dining. My response time is fast and friendly. ",

Close to multiple wineries and hiking trails. Host was very responsive.",

    "access": "The entire house aside from a few locked areas are available to the guests.  The vineyard is accessible by approval only as chemical may have been recently applied. Laborers and/or vineyard manager may be onsite for maintenance but will not impinge on guest areas.",
    "notes": "Sleeps 8 adults and up to 5 children.  Additional adults must be approved and will incur a surcharge even if there are no children, as additional adults will require furniture to be moved, air beds to be setup, etc.",
    "interaction": "In most cases I will be within 30 minutes to an hour away In case a guest requires in person assistance. Otherwise the guests will have full privacy. \n\nAs the house is located on a working vineyard, there may be occasions where laborers or the property manager are on- site. They will remain within the vineyard space.",
    "house_rules": "- Only the guests numbered in the original reservation are permitted on the property.  Additional guests (even temporary visitors) must be pre-approved by the property owner.

Locks must be in place when the hot tub area is not supervised by adults.\n- You are here to party- please have a great time!  The basement recreation area is specifically suited for rowdier activities.  Please reserve the upper living areas for less rambunctious gatherings.  This reduces risk to the guests and the host for damages.\n- Pool is generally open from Memorial Day to Labor Day.  Season may be extended if weather permits.\n- No glass by the pool, no running or horseplay by the pool. Obviously no peeing in the pool :-). \n- Chemical sprays may have been applied in the vineyard that require a time interval before reentry.

Inquire at booking. \n- Please respect other posted rules and instructions for the use of the hot tub, sauna and other appliances/amenities.  This is for guest safety and enjoyment. \n- Do not hesitate to reach out to the property manager with any questions/concerns/suggestions or to report any issue or accident.  The goal is for you to enjoy your stay to the fullest! As long as you respect the space like you would if it were yours, all parties will be happy.  Accidents can happen regardless of the utmost care and we understand that.  Early reporting of any issues will help minimize damage and expense.  Thank you!",

THANK YOU.\n\n Hello!  My name is Camilla.  I am originally from Washington DC but have lived all over the world—Spain, England, France, Germany, Okinawa, San Francisco, Seattle—to name a few.  \n\nI have retired from my job as a Proposal Developer with a nationwide medical staffing company.  I earned my BFA at Goddard College at the age of 62--a life-long goal, finally achieved.\n\nI have two children—a son who lives in Houston with his wife and baby daughter, and a daughter who has just become a physician and will be moving to Louisville, Kentucky, to begin her internship with her husband, an IT professional.\n\nI am an avid reader and belong to two book clubs.  I am slowly beginning to enjoy gardening.  I go to an exercise class for old ladies like me, and a yoga class.  Absolutely love music of all kinds, especially blues, rock and Latino.\n\nTwenty-eight years ago we moved to Howard County to raise our family, and we never left.  The countryside is beautiful, peaceful and quiet.  As you can see from my photos, the view from my front door is truly rural Maryland at its best.\n\nSykesville was just named The Coolest Small Town in America.  It is also one of the safest. The businesses are independently owned.  There are four unique clothing stores, a great book store, and an excellent hair salon.  There are five small restaurants, including a creperie, a sports bar, a higher-end eatery which is a converted train station, a wine bar, and a deli.  We have a farmer’s market every Sunday morning, just off Main Street.   It is a wonderful place to live.\n\nI would love to have you stay with me and experience Sykesville, as I do every day.\n\nWelcome!  \n\n\n",

The space was quaint and comfortable and has its own entrance outside. There were snacks, coffee/tea/water, and appliances to heat things up. The bed was super comfortable and I loved the pillows! It was very homey, with places to eat, work, or rest. There was a closet to hang clothes, two suitcase caddies, a heater (if needed), and a dehumidifier (which worked a lot being the summer and after a major storm). I loved that it was super quiet so I could concentrate on working when I needed to, and it was very close to downtown Sykesville and Eldersburg, where I needed to be during my stay. There was separate parking, which was convenient.  This space is in a lovely wooded, quiet location. I would stay at Camilla's again if the need arose for me to stay in the area.  Highly recommend!",

Would be great if it had a tv. If you haven’t slept in a full size (double) bed- and there are 2 of you (average size)- it’s just not comfortable. I can see being comfortable enough for 1 person, but 2 of us just didn’t sleep well at all. The mattress is just ok- the bedding was spectacular. It was cool and dry in the basement and I loved the white noise provided by the dehumidifier. Charles loved the snacks. The design is kitschy- and cool. An upgraded and larger bed would have made it perfect. I did see it was full size when I booked- but haven’t slept in that size bed in almost 20 years. I read that the bed was an issue for other guests- but you just don’t think it’s going to be a problem….until it is.",

A beautiful space with lots of room for our family of 4 and our pup. Our girls were very comfortable on the pullout couch and bathrooms and kitchen were both generous sizes. Outside was just as nice with spaces to enjoy the peaceful neighborhood. Linda and Rob were so nice and welcoming to us and our children. We got to feed their chickens and fish and take a dip in their refreshing pool. We even got to meet one of their cute pups. We hope to stay again and would definitely recommend to anyone coming to the area!",

And although the cottage has great lighting and around it, the surroundings of the cottage are quite dark as well. If you love cottage/cabin in the middle of the wilderness, then this place is 100% for you. My kids were a little nervous at night. But I absolutely loved it! Totally worth it!",

For more information please look up:  Cinderella Freedom Incineration Toilet\nThere is no odor, is connected to power and gas, and it only requires guests to use a filter, sit while using, close the lid and press a button.  That's it!  The instructions are clearly marked and are available in the Loft in multiple places.\nAdditionally, we have installed a sophisticated irrigation recycling system that utilizes all of the \"grey\" water from the shower and the sink to irrigate our landscaping beds surrounding the Barn area.",

I am happiest when touring young and older folks around the farm, teaching about where our food comes from, healthy farming and gardening that leads to healthy soil, waterways, humans, and critters.  Forests are my playgrounds.  Our young adult children help and that is the best!  Frederick, MD is a favorite place on this planet to eat, walk, talk with shop owners and artists, and attend Quaker Meeting for Worship.  This precious part of Maryland is a wonderful place to visit and live.",

The restored farmhouse is in a tranquil location, surrounded by fields, forests, and trails.  Wide-planked wooden floors, found treasures from the farmland and creek, beds piled high with handmade quilts, and porches with views that immediately lower your blood pressure and make you sigh, “aah” create a haven for a weekend getaway, family vacation, working retreat, and learning adventure.\n- 1 bedroom with queen bed and full sized futon\n- 1 bedroom with double bed and 2 twin beds\n- 1 bedroom with 3 twin beds\n- 1 bedroom with 4 twin beds\n- 1 downstairs room with double futon\nFull kitchen with dishwasher\nHalf bath on first floor, 2 full baths and washer/dryer on second floor.\nWhen you want to explore beyond the farm, lovely downtown Frederick offers a variety of shops, award winning restaurants, parks, performing arts theaters, Frederick Keys minor league baseball, and free concerts during the summer months.  Jefferson, I dare say, has one of the best pastry shops within 100 miles.  Let the sweet smell of homemade donuts and cakes guide you!  Harper’s Ferry, Antietam, Sharpsburg, and even Gettysburg are all within a 20-50 minute drive for those who relish civil war history.  For the adventurer in you, take a rafting or tubing trip down the Shenandoah or Potomac Rivers, or head up to Annapolis Rocks for a climb, or even hike a section of the Appalachian Trail – all within 20-30 minutes of the farm.  There are several wineries and ciders within 10-40 minutes of the farm that give tours and tastings regularly, as well as breweries that create some tasty beer.\nWe take extra care in disinfecting all surfaces and linens when we clean.",

Christine is prompt with messages and had paper towels sent to us when they were missing. The pool is AMAZING. It is heated, clean, and has an intriguing auto cover build in. We had a blast there for about an hour our first evening and I took the baby back for about 45 mins the next morning. There was a camp going on and we weren’t able to swim for the entire next afternoon, which was disappointing as that was the only other time we could have on our one full day. Returning from dinner our last night we had no power, and it was getting hot. As well as we needed a working fridge and electricity for my breast milk and pump. We also had refrigerated medicine. Electricity was scheduled to come back 12-3am. We couldn’t risk it. Christine thinks we should have and it wasn’t a big deal. I had to fight for a small portion of one night back. 145/840$",

My kids and I really enjoyed picking berries right next to the cottage and around the farm!  The cottage was updated and clean.  The kitchen had everything we needed for our 9 day stay!  We were even able to make a peach raspberry cobbler with the raspberries we picked on property and the peaches we got at the Great Country Farm nearby.\n\nChristine was a fantastic host!  She was super responsive and took care of anything we needed as well as made amazing local suggestions!  She also made sure we had private time at the beautiful pool area!  My son even went to the horse camp during the day while we were there!  \n\nThank you, Christine, for such a wonderful, relaxing stay in your lovely cottage!\n\nP.S. If you are traveling to this area, I highly recommend Magnolia's in Purcellville, especially if you have gluten allergies!",

We found the house and furnishing to be very comfortable and we had everything we needed during our stay.   The A/C units worked great to keep the house temperature nice and cool for summer weather.  We  enjoyed seeing wildlife which included several deer sightings and swans in a nearby pond.   There were also  fireflies that beautifully lit up the field and trees in the evenings.   Highly recommend the house for anyone looking to stay in the area!",

My kids adored the goats, and wanted to spend all their time with them. And Sarah and Matt were so patient with my kids following them around asking a million questions. Sarah even let my son help plant cilantro. The house has everything you could need to cook and feel at home. We felt so lucky to get to experience what they've created in the beautiful village of Waterford.",

    "summary": "We restored this 1820 village farmhouse in 2016. It is situated in the heart of the historic village of Waterford. It has 2 1/2 acres behind, with two barns, a herd of very friendly goats,  chickens, and vegetable, herb and flower gardens. The house backs up to The Phillips Farm, 150 acres of preserved land and public walking trails. Beautiful sunset views from the back porch. The house, a work in progress, was featured in both Country Living and Preservation Magazines.",
    "space": "The house has a rustic feel. The bathroom (on the second floor) has a great tub for baths and a shower. The sink is very old and beautiful, but shows it's age! There are three bedrooms for guest use - one on the second floor with two twins, another on the second floor with a queen bed, and one on the third floor with a king bed and sitting area.   The bathroom is on the second floor. The house is heated by radiators and we have a wood stove in  the cozy kitchen sitting area. There is no AC in the kitchen - only in the  bedrooms. There is a front and back/side porch and large yard with separate vegetable, herb and flower gardens and a fire pit and chairs. The cooking stove in the kitchen is commercial and has 10 burners and 2 ovens and uses propane. There is also one wood burning fireplace on the first floor in one of the two living rooms. There is a dishwasher and coffee maker in the kitchen, which is fully stocked with pantry items and pots and pans, etc. The tap water is well water that's filtered and tested regularly. The kitchen is the space we live in - it has a dining table and a cozy living room area by the wood stove. There is a great outside shower and bathtub. The chickens love to be around people and the goats love snuggles! For most of the late spring and summer  the goats are out on jobs clearing brush, so won't be around. During the growing season, all produce, herbs, berries and eggs are available for harvest in the garden and chicken coop!",
    "access": "Guests are welcome in any area of the house. The back two acres are separated by a fence and gate and guests are welcome to explore and hang out with the goats back there, when they are here. We are in the process of restoring barns and building a greenhouse back there. We are usually working on these projects in the back or on the garden so will be around. We also run the Corner Store in town so are pretty much always in the village should you need anything!\n\nWe can only allow 6 guests on the property, unless previously arranged with us. This is very firm.",
    "notes": "We are unable to accommodate any wedding related rentals.\n\nWe can only allow 6 guests on the property, unless previously arranged. This is very firm.",
    "neighborhood": "Waterford is a charming village. There are many beautiful old houses and building that have been well-cared for and preserved. We run the Corner Store  in the center of the town, a little shop that sells local and handmade things for the home and garden, beer and wine, coffee and house made croissants. There is a wonderful walking trail that can be accessed  behind the Mill at the end of town. It goes all the way to the dam that used to feed the mill race. There are many farms, vineyards and breweries around the area to explore, as well as a handful of good restaurants, our favorites being Market Table Bistro, Market Burger, Field and Main, The Wine Kitchen and Fireworks Pizza.",
    "interaction": "We will meet you at the property to show you all the things, and then be available as needed. We will be around the property working in the garden and in the back barns daily. There may occasionally be a gardener (Daniel) working in the garden during the growing season.",
    "house_rules": "Please take off shoes before entering the house.\n\nNo more than 6 guests allowed on the property.",

    "summary": "This house sleeps 6 but we have an extra guest cottage available on the property with a separate driveway about 200' from the main house should you need to sleep 8 pending availability. Please reach out to enquire about this before booking, should you need lodging for 8 people as the guest house has a separate listing and may already be booked.",
    "space": "Welcome to this beautiful remodeled historic home, bordering Goose Creek, enjoy this peaceful home where you will only hear and see birds and wildlife and an occasional horse or two but only 5 min from downtown Middleburg.\n\nThe main house has 3 bedrooms and sleeps 6, two on the upstairs floor that is joined by one large bathroom with separate toilet. On the main floor is another bedroom that has a VERY comfortable pull out couch with a private toilet and has a full bathroom on the lower level. It's a 200 year authentic former \"farm \"house that has been fully restored, so the layout is not your standard one.  The guest cottage has a separate listing on airbnb (called super cosy cottage on large estate) , but can be rented with the main house so everyone can be together. Hence is why the listing states that it sleeps 8. If you would like to book for 8 people though, I will need to check that the guest house is available during that weekend as it has a separate listing on airbnb.\n\nBeing an interior designer from Belgium, I designed  the main house with an eclectic yet rustic feel, that is warm and inviting. It's not what you will find typically in the Middleburg area, as it has a  European flavor, but it has been completely remodeled and offers everything you would need as if you were staying at a boutique hotel with a kitchen. Comfortable bed with feather duvet, hardwood floor, full kitchen including dishwasher and microwave  a rain shower in the bathroom and a big screen TV with comfortable seating in the living room and a historic stone patio.\n\nWe also have a few private chefs available for your consideration, if you would like to have a home cooked meal, picnic or be taken care of, culinary wise ,during your entire stay. If you are interested please let me know and I can send you my recommendations.",
    "access": "The property is set on very private 22 acres, at the end of a gravel road, backed to Goose Creek where you can go for walks for hours, go to the creek, to Middleburg town or the Spa at the Salamandar, all 5' away, or visit some of the best wineries in VA that is starting at 3 miles from our house (Greenhill).",
    "notes": "Again, if you would like to book for 8 people, let me know so that I can check if the guest house is available. We have only used the best materials during this remodeling and are only interested in people that appreciate a high end home and will treat it with respect. This is NOT  a \"hunt cabin\".",

And we are also AirBNB hosts ourselves and love sharing our historic farmhouse and Brewery with others.\n\nIn our daily life, when not working obsessively, we spend much of our time with our kids, hiking the farm, taking care of our many animals and hanging with friends. We travel to escape the busy life of brewery ownership. We love Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania, New England, and Europe.\n\nMy travel style is relaxed mixed with a little on-the-go. I like to get up, get out and explore, find some good food and pack it in early. ",

    "summary": "Welcome to your own quiet oasis in the city.  This 2 bd/1ba basement apartment sits on 2 acres and backs to Accotink Creek and Fairfax County parkland.  Inside, you'd never suspect it's a basement. An abundance of light pours in through its oversized windows.  An open floor plan, huge leather Lay-Z-Boy  sofa, and 65' smart TV make it easy to spend time together.  The primary bdrm has a Tempurpedic mattress, TV, walk-in closet, and bay window.  A W/D is located in the 2nd bdrm's walk-in closet.",
    "space": "This approximately 1700 SQFT apartment has it's own private entrance facing the private wooded backyard that is accessed by steps leading down from the driveway.\n\nYou enter into the huge open-concept living/dining/kitchen area.  A large desk is tucked to the side of the entryway.  \n\nThe living room has a huge u-shaped La-Z-Boy leather couch with plenty of seating.  It faces the wood-burning fireplace and 65' smart TV with access to live TV and your favorite streaming services.  If more than 4 guests, a twin or queen-sized tri-fold memory foam mattress and folding bedframe can be set up in the living room.  Please stipulate in your reservation which bed size is preferred.\n\nThe kitchen has it ALL!  It includes a full-size, dual-zone oven with electric cooktop, full-size refrigerator, sink, microwave, Ninja coffeemaker, french press,  coffee, blender, mixer, crock pot, bakeware, spices, oil & vinegar, and plenty of pots, pans, dishes, glasses (wine and water),  and tupperware.  Plates and glasses especially for children and for eating outdoors are also included.  \n\nThe handmade solid wood dining table and chairs offer plenty of space for 6 people.\n\nThe large primary bedroom is the perfect retreat.  Enjoy a good night's sleep on the king-sized Tempurpedic mattress perched on a beautiful, antique, hand-carved, solid wood frame.  Looking out the large bay window to the tree-lined backyard, you'd never know you were in the middle of the city.  You'll have plenty of space for your clothing in the dresser and oversized walk-in closet.  Lastly, the wall-mounted smart TV pulls out to provide the perfect viewing angle from the bed or sofa.\n\nThe cozy second bedroom is located in the house interior and does not have any windows.  However, it is well lit and includes a trundle-bed dresser, and walk-in closet with a washer and dryer.\n\nFinally, outside on the porch, you can kick back at your teak patio table while using your Weber grill.  If you are feeling especially spunky, you can make your way down the path to Accotink Creek.  IMPORTANT, the path down to the creek is steep and slippery after it rains.  The walk takes about 5 minutes.  Please be careful.  Once you make it down,  you can enjoy a short walk, swim, rock scramble, or just relax on one of the giant boulders or small sandy banks.  You can even try your hand at fishing, though we haven't had the best luck actually \"catching.\" \n\nThe Urban Oasis has it all but if you want to venture out, a wide variety of shopping, dining, and entertainment opportunities await.  Additionally, we are located about 10 minutes from the Springfield-Franconia Metro (which offers daily parking for $5) and as little as 20 minutes from the Pentagon and DC.\n\nWe are constantly working on updates to the apartment between guests.  Check back to see what's new.  Coming soon... dishwasher, new cabinets, and new paint in the living area and bathroom.\n\n**PETS**\nPets will be approved on a case-by-case basis.  There is a $50/pet/stay fee and an additional $200 refundable pet deposit.  Payment for 2+ pets and pet deposit will be collected after the booking is confirmed through the booking platform.  The deposit will be refunded within 48 hours of checkout if no damages are identified.  No animals with a history of aggression or property destruction are permitted.  Unattended pets must be crated/caged.  Please, no loud pets.\n\nWe hope to host you soon!  If you have any questions about the area, don't hesitate to reach out.  Amy is a real estate agent who loves sharing information about her city.",
    "access": "Guests have private access to the apartment unit and the porch area underneath the upper deck.  The backyard is a shared space but the front yard is for owner use only and is where our dog spends her time when she's outside.",
    "notes": "Please note, we have a well-behaved 60 lb dog that is often outside but always supervised.  You can see a picture of her in one of the photos.  She will likely bark when you arrive and is a little timid however she is harmless and very friendly once she gets to know you.  \n\nWhile we are relatively quiet, this is a basement apartment.  Expect to hear a few footsteps and the occasional dog bark when someone comes to the front door.",
    "neighborhood": "Small quiet residential neighborhood.  Home is tucked away on a beautiful tree-lined dead-end street.",
    "transit": "A car is recommended.  The unit comes with 2 reserved driveway parking spaces.",

Nestled in a quiet valley in the heart of Northern Virginia’s wine country, Linden is the perfect foil to the hustle and bustle of the big city. \n\nI'm originally from Los Angeles, and speak English, American Sign Language, French, and Spanish, in order of fluency, and have quite a list of other languages I'm hoping to learn soon!",

Chrysalis is about a 40 min drive, but the Margherita pizza, Sarah’s Patio White & the view is the die for. \nThe pictures do not do the property and home justice. Kyle & Cory have thought of everything you might need while staying in their home. Forgot a toiletry? They have it! Love fresh ground coffee, but don’t want to bring a coffee grinder? They have one! Along with the coffee, sugar and creamer. The beds were super comfortable. It was a little warm upstairs, but the ceiling fans put out a lot of air, so it makes it comfortable. We didn’t end up using the beds in the basement, but if you’d prefer a cooler temp while sleeping, the basement is for you. I would definitely recommend this as your little home away from home.",

    "summary": "Come visit Virginia wine country and nearby Shenandoah National Park in this modern log cabin.\n\nThe Cedarbank cabin carries all the conveniences of modern living including updated kitchen and WiFi (see note). Though the grounds are only an hour from Washington DC, Cedarbank feels like a world apart, providing relaxing views and 7 tranquil acres for the perfect rejuvenating country escape.",
    "space": "You’ll have access to our peaceful grounds - 7 acres of quiet woodland - with nature at your front step.\n\nThe house has 3 bedrooms and 2 full bathrooms, a modern kitchen, dining room, and large living room with stone fireplace.\n\nOutside, you can take advantage of the front patio for al fresco dining, use the grill, or swing in the hammocks. \n\nThe Appalachian Trail crosses our road just 1 mile north, stellar Linden Vineyards is immediately adjacent, and scenic Shenandoah Valley is 15 minutes away.\n\nDogs are allowed, up to two total per stay. We have cats on the property, so please monitor your dogs while outside.\n\nWe welcome children of all ages. The cabin does not have toddler safety measures such as locks on low cabinets or outlet covers, but there is a portable crib provided.",
    "access": "You’ll have access to our entire house except a locked garage. There is a barn on the property which is also locked. Otherwise, you'll have access to the rest of the property adjacent to the cabin. We live on the property, too, but are just over a ridge. Please make yourself at home!",
    "notes": "SOME VERY IMPORTANT NOTES\n\nDRIVEWAY: Our driveway is steep and graveled, and can be difficult for small passenger cars to get up especially during wet, snowy, or icy conditions. We recommend using a 4WD vehicle if possible. We are not responsible for you getting up the driveway, and will not provide refunds if you can’t make it up for any reason, including weather. The country is a wonderful place to relax, but it comes with some challenges, too. \n\nINTERNET: Our internet connection is VERY slow. Think DSL speeds. We estimate average speeds to be 2-2.5 Mbps. You may not be able to hold a Zoom call or send large files, though email and texting work fine.\n\nGUEST COUNT: No parties, and no additional guests beyond the (up to) 6 guests booked through Airbnb. Guests beyond the confirmed amount will be reported to Airbnb (per our local restrictions).\n\nSECURITY: One outdoor security camera shows who is coming and going, but for your privacy, only the driveway and front door are visible – we can send you a picture from the camera if you'd like.\n\nNOISE: Our tiny valley is very sleepy and quiet. It’s the perfect place to relax and enjoy the calm of the country. We’ll also be your neighbors during your stay. Cedarbank is not a place for parties. Also, because sound travels easily, please no loud conversations after dark and music outside at any time.",
    "neighborhood": "Cedarbank is nestled in the Virginia countryside in the middle of Shenandoah wine country. You also have easy access to the Appalachian Trail, the Shenandoah River, Shenandoah National Park, and Front Royal, a quaint country town with shopping and dining options.\n\nThe area is incredibly quiet and will afford you a relaxing escape from the hustle and bustle of the city.",
    "transit": "The town of Linden is just off I-66, about 1 hour and 15 minutes west of Washington, DC. Cedarbank is about 2.5 miles south of Linden, tucked into a pretty valley that's home to Linden Vineyards and several working cattle farms.",
    "house_rules": "In order to preserve the serene nature of our little valley, we ask the following: No amplified music outside, no outdoor fires or fireworks, please keep outdoor conversation quiet after dark.",

      "about": "Hello! Here’s a little info about myself. I’m 31 years old and have lived in the northern Virginia area my whole life. I moved to my amazing cottage in Paris, VA in April of 2018 and have loved every second of it.   when the Cottage was purchased, it needed a little TLC. While I have been doing small things since I’ve lived there, there is still plenty to do! I love the outdoors; hiking, fishing, and driving my boat. I graduated from Radford University with a degree in Criminal Justice, but resorted to my true love of Construction Management. Ive worked as a carpenter throughout college to help pay the bills, and then worked as a project manager for a large new home cabinet company.  I then translated my skills I learned there into being a project manager for a large residential home builder in the area. I have now been a transportation inspector for a local engineering firm for almost 3 years now, working on very large VDOT road improvement projects. Needless to say, I consider myself to have considerable knowledge of construction, which is why I fell in love with the potential of my cottage! Anyways, I hope you’ve learned a little about me! And I hope you get to enjoy my cottage in the little town of Paris!",

    "summary": "Welcome to my home! This house was built post civil war era in 1867 in the historical town of Paris, Virginia! With lots of history and character this house still has some of the original exposed beams and hardwood flooring! If you enjoy the outdoors, wineries, breweries, and shopping this is a perfect location for your stay! Minutes from the Appalachian trail, and Sky Meadows park there’s plenty of hiking around. Famous Ashby Inn restaurant just a short walk away and many more amazing places!",
    "space": "You’ll be very cozy in this 150 year old home! A town that was originally built with much larger plans was halted once the civil war happened. A very unique neighborhood with almost all the homes built in the 17 and 1800's surrounded by nothing but farm land seems to be frozen in time! This is my personal home, so there will be a few items kept in the home, but out of the way of your stay! :)\n\nPlease keep in mind that this area is subject to (sometimes) bad thunderstorms and snow storms that could leave you without power for a few hours and in extreme cases a day or two.  Please understand that this is out of my control.  All I can do is report the outage to the power company ASAP.",
    "access": "You are able to park in front of the home as well as a driveway that parks 2 cars.",
    "notes": "Verizon seems to be the only cellular service that works in this location. However I do have a wireless hotspot that works very well if you need to use your phone, computer tablet or stream anything you want on any of my smart TVs (bedroom, living room and upstairs). I also have plenty of DVDs upstairs if you’d like to watch a movie!",
    "neighborhood": "Very cozy town, 15 minutes from historic town and shops in Middleburg. 25 minutes from the historic town of Winchester. About 40 minutes drive to skyline drive. 5 minute drive to Sky Meadows State Park and about a 5 minute drive to the Shenandoah River!  Also very close to many hikes on the Appalachian trail!  Dozens of wineries and breweries around, all within a short driving distance.  This is of course Virginia Wine Country.  The Ashby Inn (which is about a 100 yard walk) offers exquisite cuisine, and drink!  And very close to to Upperville for horse events. There is nothing more peaceful than the town of Paris.\n\nI should note that the closet grocery store is about 15 minutes away, and often the Ashby Inn requires reservations (in advance).  Just wanted to note so you're prepared when you get here.",

However, if you plan on going to any stores, a car will be needed to go there, unless you plan on eating at the infamous Ashby Inn!  Please do keep in mind, the Ashby Inn and Tavern is very popular and will need reservations in advance.  Also, the closest grocery store is approximately 15 minutes away in Middleburg.

She answered all of my kids’ questions patiently. The farm was peaceful and we really loved when the dogs would come around to say hi.",

That is really a nice thing, especially when you travel in and don't bring a lot of food. She also provided plenty of towels in the bathroom. All in all, this is just an adorable place to stay.

The home is welcoming with a wonderful layout. The beds and pillows were comfortable.  My little girl loved the toys and floor keyboard.  There was so much space for a large family. The hosts really thought of everything.  Well lit space, clear instructions,  and a wonderful view of pasture and hills. Everything worked well, and we would love to come back to stay longer!",

The house had everything we needed to arrive feeling welcomed and comfortable.  What a gorgeous place and location!  So spacious with fun things to do at the house to connect as a family (games, corn hole, a large table to seat 8 for a meal).  It felt grand with high ceilings and the rich wood arch entry ways, that gave it warm character.  We appreciated the art and uplifting messages above bedroom doors and around the house.  The place had everything one would need and then some.  It was so relaxing to enjoy family time with no worries about anything.  The house accommodated 6 of us and not one of us wanted to leave.  It’s something special when teenagers want to stay because the home and property are so beautiful.  We were already talking about planning another vacation at Markham house prior to leaving.  Thank you for a 5+ experience!",

Maggie was very responsive, quickly confirming our reservation and even ensuring the property was ready for us for an early check-in! We were traveling with several dogs and we found the property to be very dog friendly. The intended space within the house for the dogs was spacious and the yard allowed them space to walk outside of the vehicle. This was one of the most beautiful homes our family has ever stayed in, with gorgeous rural porch views and a backdrop of peaceful crickets and bullfrogs at night. We enjoyed laying in the hammock and gazing at the stars. The fire pit was a great addition to our night and we found the wood allocation plentiful. The house is spacious and uncluttered with a cozy-modern-cabin vibe; it has an open floor plan with adorable twinkle lights and modern fixtures such as adjustable lighting, fans and modern bathrooms throughout the home! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",

        "comments": "I stayed at Jason and Nikki’s guest house for four nights just before Easter. Home: it’s a 1950s/1960s 3BR, approx. 1500 sq ft., well built and in very good shape. All clean, uncluttered, good natural light. The bright master bedroom has high comfy bed and lovely view over field towards Jason & Nikki’s house.  Other bedroom is smaller, darker, cooler during a hot day. Third, smallest bedroom is laundry room. Area: at the far end of a new suburban development, there’s a dirt road to the house, from which all you see is sky and gently rolling land. On the bench swing I enjoyed gentle breezes and sweet, clean air. Since it was peak egg-laying season, I had fresh chicken and duck eggs every day! Hosts: Nikki was busy but attentive, and I enjoyed a crafts evening with her eldest. Problems: a brief electricity outage, but Nikki texted as she heard from the local utility and even got the toilet working again! A folding chair from the porch provides a seat with back at the dining table.",

Lovely sunshine through the front bedroom windows. We felt very welcome with our two dogs. (If your dogs are runners like ours, they will need to be leashed outside as there is no dog fencing). We wrapped ourselves up and had some lovely & peaceful walks around the farm. The hosts were friendly and responsive.",

Although it was a brief stay it was exactly what we needed! The AirBnB is far from the main house, enough to feel private, but Nikki was very responsive whenever we needed anything. The house is simple but comfortable, like going home to grandma's house. The real draw was the land - we enjoyed walking around and our pups loved running all over. The kitchen is well stocked with cookware but guests will need to bring their own cooking oil, spices etc. During our stay Nikki let us know that there was family member staying in the basement. We never heard or saw her (the basement has a private entrance). Overall, we would recommend this place to anyone looking for a peaceful, no-frills retreat to the country (especially if you have fur babies that love to run around!)",

We loved that it was out in the country but also not far from Purcellville or Charles Town, WV for groceries or places to eat. There are vineyards/winery’s within a few miles! If we are ever back this way, we will definitely be staying again!",

It is located inside the vinyard, so you are actually inside of the country-side itself sorrounded by green and peace. The barn is is far enough from the main house that we only ran into her once and felt as we had all the place for ourselves. Definitely recommend.",

    "summary": "Barn apartment in the upper level of a bank barn. Fourteen miles from downtown Leesburg, 5 miles from Harper's Ferry, 1 mile from VA-9 Appalachian trail head.  Close to Harper's Ferry Adventure Center, wineries, breweries, tubing, kayaking, hiking, farms. Full kitchen. Unplugged - no satellite, TV, or Internet.  There is cell signal.  Rate includes 6% Virginia state tax and 7% Loudoun County hotel tax. 1 queen bed, 1 twin, and 1 floor mattress (pull out futon).",
    "space": "The apartment has a spacious MBR with queen bed and a second bedroom with twin.  There is a loveseat that folds out into basically a mattress on the floor, mostly suitable for kids or young people.  There is no separate dining room - the kitchen has an extra counter with barstools.  The living room is small, with a little couch and two chairs.  It has a TV/DVD player.  Note there is no satellite or cable, you will want to bring movies (there is a small collection in the apartment).  This is an unplugged experience.  We have coyote, bear, hawks, various waterfowl, amphibians, foxes, groundhogs, weasels, raccoons and opossums, although many are shy and rare to see.  There is a great open space for sky viewing, and you may catch us out there sometimes.",
    "access": "Roam the grounds, light a fire and sit around the campfire ring, relax in the hammock, use the swing, or jump on the trampoline.  If you're lucky you may hear owls or coyotes or a fox in season.  The barn cats will greet you and love any pets you're willing to give.  There are two chairs by the campfire ring, and extra folding chairs in the barn loft.  The apartment is on the upper level of the barn.  The chairs and fire ring are across the driveway from the barn, down a slight hill.",
    "notes": "The thermostat is in the hallway - feel free to adjust it for comfort.",
    "neighborhood": "There are many local attractions and recreation spots within a few minutes drive. Many of them are in the guidebook.  However, the guidebook doesn't let me add events and activities that don't have a physical address, so here are some you might want to know about.\nRight here on site, local astrophotographer Andrew Baker conducts sky tours and demonstrates the techniques and equipment he uses to catch the amazing shots on his website.  Contact him to arrange a sky tour here:\nhttps://thebackyardcosmos.wixsite.com/astro/tours\nOr on Facebook (you can also see some awesome photos there):\nhttps://www.facebook.com/thebackyardcosmos/\n\nYou can fly over the area:\nhttps://balikoutdoors.com/nature-flightseeing\n\nVisit the Mountain Heritage Arts and Crafts festival if you're here one of the two weekends (spring and fall):\nhttp://www.mhacfestival.org/\n\nAs a former 4H parent and daughter of a dairy clubber, the Loudoun County Fair has a special place in my heart.  Learn about farming, livestock, and what beef fitting is.  Oh, and maybe go on some rides or see a show. :)\nhttp://loudouncountyfair.com/",
    "transit": "You can get here by car. That's pretty much it. We've never yet had a guest arrive by helicopter. If that's your preference, there's a decent-sized grass field which might serve as an ersatz heliport. Use at your own risk, though; note there's no aviation fuel available on-site.",
    "interaction": "I live on the property, in the house above the barn. Let me know if you'd like to meet. I have children--and they love to meet and play with all our guests, but they are especially thrilled to find out when guests are coming with kids.  Feel free to ask me anything you'd like to know about the area.",
    "house_rules": "We do have our own children, so please enjoy yourself, but do be sensible about causing a commotion late at night.  Turning off outdoor lights when you're in for the night will reduce bugs.  Please don't let our cats in to the apartment - they are not to be trusted!  This is a non-smoking property.",

My family of three along with our doggo stayed for about two weeks as we waited for our new construction home to be finished. The Honey Acres house turned out to be just what we needed. Peaceful, secluded, clean, and well appointed. There was much to love about our stay, but a few standouts….. we enjoyed cooking and eating outside on the terrace, loved  relaxing in the cozy recliners every morning  for coffee, and couldn’t wait to walk around the grounds every evening with our pup to visit the horses, donkeys, sheep, and alpaca. The horses were so curious about our dog and always came to the fences to say hello. Grocery store and gas station only about 5 min away which was great. Brian and Ann were friendly responsive hosts and we very much hope to stay again in the future.",

You drive down a driveway lined by oak trees and horse pastures filled with ponies playing with each other. At dusk, hundreds of fireflies came out covering the yard, making it look magical. There is a pond with this amazing little island in the middle. Tons of beautiful birds and landscaping is impeccable.  \nYou stay in the big house...originally built in 1820!! The kitchen has the herth, and you can literally smell the history! It's the  perfect blend of old and new. The house is like a little maze with all the additions from  the years passed. Super fun!\nAmple kitchen supplies for bigger families. Beds are super comfy. Nice linens. I was a wimp and afraid to sleep in the old part of the house the first night, but my goldilocks self got over it...perk, I sampled 2 beds! The room with the skylights has the best bed.\nThey have a grill, patio seating, fire pit, &porch. We are coming back next year & staying longer.",

There was nothing that we could have asked more for.  The house had a plentiful supply of everything and a little extra.  We could have hosted a 20 person dinner party with the supplies in the kitchen and cupboards. The game collection in the Great Room was a perfect compliment to the stunning and large dining table. There were so many places to relax and find respite inside the house. The exterior of the house is simply stunning, like a set from a movie.  We wished we could stay longer to just relax and absorb the serenity. \n\nThe beds were very comfortable, the air conditioning did its job.  The house needs another shower but it is in the future plans.  We hope to return soon!",

Our local host was very responsive and friendly and flexible (kindly let us check in early so our toddler could get down for a nap). Our kiddo LOVED watching the horses in the nearby field and also enjoyed spotting a baby fox by the road near the house. Close to all our favorite spots in Sperryville and the surrounding area and got to check out the cafe and Irish pub in Flint Hill for the first time, both of which were lovely. Highly recommend!!",

I'm originally from northwest Ohio but have been living in Northern Virginia since 2009. \n\nBy day, I'm a mild-mannered supervisor for a rental car company at Dulles Airport but I moonlight as a hobby farmer! My wife, Ely, and I raise chickens for eggs and ducks for fun as well as grow produce in our garden. Combine that with all of the weeding and yard work that comes with a three-acre property we stay pretty busy!\n\nWe are also big dog-lovers and have a golden retriever named Lindy and a lab mix named Ellie. They love exploring their yard in the country and taking walks in the neighborhood with us on weekends before it gets too hot!\n\nLastly, I'm a soccer and baseball nut. You can usually find me glued to my TV if my beloved West Ham United or Detroit Tigers are playing! I'm looking forward to our next trip to Europe to visit some additional soccer 'cathedrals'.\n\nI have lived all over Northern Virginia but I really found happiness in the peace and tranquility of western Loudoun County. There's tons to see and do if I ever had the free time to do it!",

From Harper’s Ferry Brewery for lunch and few adult beverages, followed by dinner at a local restaurant recommended by Bradley in a very detailed book located in the immaculate rental, to exploring Harper’s Ferry that evening and then a very peaceful night’s rest before a 9 mile hike before heading home, Bradley’s place gave us a fantastic place to use as a home base for a whirlwind weekend.  We were able to meet the owners and they were very welcoming and friendly.  We adored the chicken and the rooster, Einstein.  We look forward to coming back again when we can spend more time exploring this wonderful area and staying at this beyond perfect rental  that was very clean and so overall perfection.  There is not one negative remark I could say about this rental except I wish we had been there longer.",

    "summary": "Perfectly situated away from the hustle of the nation’s capital but nestled right in among scenic parks, historic farms and delicious craft wineries, breweries and distilleries. Enjoy the peaceful grazing of our ducks and chickens just outside your window or the nearby goats, donkeys, horses and cows while you stroll, bike or drive through the neighborhood. Whatever your preference, your stay in Loudoun will be complete with a visit to Bright Skye Farm!",
    "neighborhood": "This suite is located in the Taylorstown area of Lovettsville, giving it a true western Loudoun County vibe! We are on a single-lane gravel road but don't worry, the paved streets are close by! All of the properties in this area have minimum acreage requirements so you'll see plenty of horse and cow farms on your drive in, as well as craft beverage makers!\n\nIn terms of proximity, it is about:\n\n~ 3 minutes to Flying Ace Brewery/Distillery\n~ 5 minutes to Point of Rocks, MD\n~ 5 minutes to Lovettsville Town Square\n~ 15 minutes to Leesburg, VA\n~ 35 minutes to Dulles Airport\n~ 1 hour to Tyson's Corner, VA\n~ 1.5 hours to downtown DC\n\nWe love walking the gravel roads in the area and checking out the neighboring properties with our dogs, but for a proper trail, the C&O Trail across the river in Brunswick, MD is less than 10 minutes by car and the W&OD Trailhead is about 15-20 minutes by car in nearby Purcellville.",
    "transit": "With everything so spread out, the easiest and fastest route to everything close by is by car. We offer free parking at the unit for up to two cars and all of the fun places to visit nearby offer free parking.\n\nThat said, especially on the warmer weekends, you will be sharing the road with loads of bikers and walkers. The terrain is nicely varied so can provide spirited bike riding or walking options. \n\nBeing that we are in a rural area, there are not any regular public transportation options. There is train service to downtown DC during commuter hours in both Brunswick and Point of Rocks, MD, with the last train going in at 7:55am and leaving DC to return out here at 7:25pm. \n\nUber and Lyft do drop off in this area, but it's best to make an appointment ahead of time if you need picked up from here.",
    "interaction": "We live in the main house adjacent to the suite and at least one of us is usually home. You may see us working outside in the yard or with the birds so feel free to say hello! We're here to make your stay as convenient and comfortable as possible, so shoot us a note on the Airbnb Messenger or ring the door bell and we'll do our best to accommodate!",
    "house_rules": "Please be mindful of your noise volume. Quiet time is between 10pm & 7am. \n\nOnly approved guests may visit the property. Please ensure the number of guests on your reservation request is accurate. \n\nWe love the neighborhood as much as you will, but please try to avoid bringing the neighborhood into the unit with you by removing your shoes before walking on the carpet. We will need to request a $100 cleaning fee (via the Resolution Center) if we have to steam-clean the carpet after your stay.\n\nIf you wish to use the hammock, you are welcome to open a garage door and pull it outside but please bring it back inside the garage when finished to keep it in good condition for all guests.\n\nFlush only toilet paper. We are on septic here so no paper towels, napkins, feminine hygiene products, M-80's, car keys or anything else that could damage our system.\n\nWe are huge animal lovers and would love to allow dogs but we want to keep our animals safe and stress-free so unfortunately no pets will be permitted on premises. There will be a $100 pet fee requested to cover the extra cost of cleaning if a pet's presence is noted.\n\nThe space is in a rural, wooded area that features wildlife of all kinds. That said, you might see an occasional insect or small animal (ant, spider, snake, raccoon), particularly in the summer. This might not be great for the nature-phobic. \n\nNo smoking on the property, inside or outside. If we smell or find evidence of smoking, there will be a $100 fee requested.\n\nThe guest suite is above a functioning garage and Owner will occasionally need to access the main floor garage area in order to retrieve supplies, carry out maintenance on the property, or to simply use the car parked inside. Owner will always do so only outside of quiet hours, except in emergency situations.\n\nWhile all electrical and mechanical equipment within the Property are in good working order, Owner cannot guarantee against mechanical failure of electrical service, stopped plumbing, water supply, heating, air conditioning, audio visual equipment, internet access, cable service, or appliances. Guest agrees to report any inoperative equipment or other maintenance problem to Owner immediately. Owner will make every reasonable effort to have repairs done quickly and efficiently. Guest will allow Owner or a person permitted by Owner access to the Property for purposes of repair and inspection. \n\nOwner is not responsible for any accidents, injuries or illness that occur to any member of the Rental Party or Guest’s visitors while in the Property or on the Property. \n\nOwner is not responsible for loss of personal belongings or valuables belonging to any member of the Rental Party or any of Guest’s visitors. Guest agrees to assume the risk of any harm arising from use of the Property.",

Originally from Canton Connecticut, I moved with my husband to Shenandoah Junction 10 years ago to establish a healthier life style thru organic farming. \r\n\r\nWe reside in a historic, 300+ year old home that  is a constant project of love. \r\n\r\nI am also an antique dealer who restores or chalk paints vintage and antique furniture and accessories like the antique mirror you will find in the powder room of the cottage.  My grandfather was an Italian craftsman and furniture maker. I am thankful for the skill he passed on to me. \r\n\r\nI learned how to cook from both my Italian grandmother and my father. Their love of food and everything I learned from them has helped tremendously in creating and maintaining a vegan diet. \r\n\r\nI’m a big animal lover and we always have rescues at the farm. Otherwise you can find me digging in the dirt, tending to the organic veggies or several flower beds around the property.  In the winter, I prefer to hibernate in front of the fireplace with a stack of books, when not cooking. \r\n\r\nOccasionally we are able to find someone to care for the animals and farm and jump in the car or on a plane. Our last trip was a fifteen day cruise thru Asia. I believe travel is an important part of having empathy and compassion for others and it’s the best way to learn about other cultures, geography,  different cuisines and people. ",

The scene is pastoral overlooking farm land. The moment we stepped inside we were delighted with the layout, the furniture, the eclectic decor and the cleanliness. \n\nThe cottage glows with cheerfulness without sacrificing serenity. Every effort has been made to provide for guest needs and comfort. Kitchen drawers were neatly organized with essential and “good equipment”.\n\nWe loved sitting on the side porch spotting the many different birds hiding in the huge tree that faces it and watching the sun set.\n\nThe cottage is close to Harper’s Ferry and Charles Town. Lots of history. Just 12 minutes away we were able to connect to the C&O Canal to ride bikes.\n\nDina was quick to respond to any questions. We were exceptionally satisfied with our stay and hope to return.",

Come let your stress melt away at our little slice of Almost Heaven West Virginia. \n\n Historic Harpers Ferry and Shepardstown, are just 8 miles from the cottage and the Hollywood Casino, just 3 miles. The Potomac and Shenandoah rivers are within 10 miles of the cottage as is the entrance to one of many hiking trails thru the Shenandoah Valley. \n\nThe cottage can sleep up to six people, but parties over four will need to send a request to book. \n\nThe property is beautiful dusted or covered in snow and bursts with color in Spring, Summer and Fall. It is a great destination for photographers or anyone who loves the serenity of a rural setting.\n\nOur historic barns, mountain views, gently rolling pastures, and the wildlife, including deer, barn swallows, eagles, blue jays, red cardinals, yellow finches and hummingbirds, ground hogs, red fox, bunnies, and the elusive coyotes that can be heard more than seen all make up Fairview Farm. You will also find:\n\n> a fire pit surrounded by large rocks and chairs for evening marshmallow toasting is just a short walk from the cottage. A stack of wood is provided. \n\n> the main house and cottage sit back from the street more than 1/4 mile so there is a feeling of seclusion without the isolation. \n\n> during the 4th of July celebration, there is a fantastic view of the fireworks from the cottage. And there is much more. \n\nThe kitchen is a cook's delight. There is a Keurig, toaster, family size pressure cooker/crock pot and microwave. We've provided a nice set of cookware, and several pieces of Corning Ware that I have collected for years. \n\nIf guests need a small appliance, such as a rice cooker,  ice cream maker, griddle, etc. Please let us know. We have several small appliances that can be brought up to the cottage in just minutes. \n\nA large gas grill is also provided on the screened in porch. Please let us know in advance if you intend to use it so we can fill the propane tank. \n\nThere is no dishwasher in the cottage.  We provide a drying mat and several wood drying racks.\n\nIn keeping with our organic lifestyle, we use as few chemical cleaners as possible in the cottage. We mainly use and provide vinegar or other cleaners without harsh chemicals. Please bring laundry soap if you plan on doing laundry during your stay.\n\nAll the doorways, hallways, and the shower were designed to be wheelchair accessible. There is a 1/4 step to enter the porch, the cottage and the shower.\n\nWhile we do not allow large, unruly parties, we can accommodate families or groups that would like to gather for the holidays at the cottage - with advance approval. We are happy to provide additional pots, pans, serving dishes, a full set of china and tables and seating, as needed. Just let us know.\n\nThe cottage is furnished with an eclectic mix of high end contemporary furniture and vintage and antique pieces. My mother's and my taste combined into a space that most of our guests have raved about. \n\nThe cottage will be tastefully decorated for holidays including a decorated tree for Christmas. \n\nIf you, your family or friends are celebrating a birthday, anniversary or holiday we are happy to provide a home baked decorated cake or cookies for an additional fee.

While the evenings are quiet, and the star filled skies, breathtaking, during planting, growing and harvest season work starts at sun up. \n\nPlease be aware The main 1/4 mile driveway is gravel and the driveway to the cottage is mostly a dirt road with a layer of gravel. We keep them entirely  passable. \n \nGuests are responsible for reading the House Manual on the App. It’s not heavy reading - just a short list of common sense rules for staying at the cottage. \n\nCheck -In Instructions on the app  include step by step photos to help find and enter the cottage. \n\nA guest without previous reviews or a completed profile will need to send a request to book. A government issued ID like a driver’s license, passport, or DMV issued walking ID are required for Airbnb to confirm your identity. A tip for those without previous reviews: the more info you can give Airbnb to confirm your identity the more comfortable your host will feel. Hosts do not see this information, we can only see that it was provided to Airbnb. \n \nOther Info: we were chosen to be the recipient of the largest tree planting eco project along Elks Run by the Conservation Department of WV Forestry. With the help of volunteers, 150 Native trees have been planted along the creek to help prevent erosion. \n\n\"Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, & narrow-mindedness... Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men & things cannot be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one's lifetime.” - Mark Twain",
    "access": "Guests are welcome to walk the property from historic barns to Elks RunCreek and view the many flower gardens.",
    "notes": "CHRISTMAS - the cottage is decorated for Christmas with high-end decorations including a 7’ tree most often dressed in a collection of woodland animal and bird ornaments. Photos of the cottage at Christmas are included in my Airbnb photo album. \nHALLOWEEN & THANKSGIVING - we also decorate for the Fall holidays but not as elaborately as Christmas.",
    "neighborhood": "We are located on the main road that runs between Charles Town and Sheperdstown.

A working dairy farm is across the street and can be seen from the cottage. The pastures of a beautiful 60 acre farm that once bred black angus,  backs to our property",
    "transit": "A car is needed to get around.",
    "interaction": "We live in the original house on the property and are available to answer questions or assist in any way we can, with just a call or text, otherwise we will respect our guests privacy.",
    "house_rules": "- The Golden Rule Applies.\n\n- cottage should be left in the same condition it was found upon arrival with the exception of towels and bed linens. \nUsed towels go in a pile on the master bath floor.\nDo NOT make the beds, so I know which beds were used. \n\n- No wet or muddy footwear in house\n\n- please do not move or rearrange the furniture or large appliances like the tv or the fridge.\n\n- No eating on white plaid chair in living room. We prefer guests use the kitchen table to eat meals. You  can see the tv from the kitchen table.\n\n- No glasses or coffee mugs in master bath\n\n-The orange carnival glass on open shelves and the vintage glass pitcher sets in the glass front cabinet are for decoration only.\n\n- No candles or open flame for any reason\n\n- The fireplace must be turned off when guests leave the cottage or go to sleep. \n\n- the leather recliner is electric and must be plugged in to recline. Please pull the sheer curtains away from the outlet to use. \n\n- We ask guests to be energy conscious and turn off lights when they are not in use. \n\n- Do not overload the washing machine or dryer. They work best with small loads. Do not wash master bedroom linens. We provide an extra set of sheets but if you need linens washed please let me know\n\n-Please only use the blankets you need. We provide several comfy throws in all rooms\n\n- Please  fold and stack any blankets, quilts, bedspreads, etc. you do not use. \n\n- cats are allowed on the porch if you want to play with them, but not allowed in the house. Please let them out (of porch) if you hear me calling for them at dusk.\n\n-Lastly, communication is one of the bedrocks of Airbnb. It would not work without it, not just for scheduling but in building trust which is also essential. \nCommunication does not end after your booking is confirmed or after you check-in. Communication ends when you have successfully checked-out. \nIf you use the app make sure you have notifications turned on your cell phone.",

It was easy to get to downtown Leesburg for the restaurants as well as the local vineyards. There are two sets of stairs, one of which creates a small, lowered section of the ceiling in the kitchen, and the house and area has woodburning stoves/fireplaces (not the main kitchen stove of course) which made the house smell of woodsmoke. The coffee machine is a Keurig, and there are also small step downs here and there so it's not a home for anyone with mobility challenges. But we found everything super charming and loved every minute of our stay.",

We had a constant supply of fresh eggs and numerous interactions between my kids and all the local animals - cows and an abundance of fowl.  We loved the house as it had ample room for our 5 kids to have their own spaces, and it had both modern touches and the feel of a pre-Revolutionary War home. We cooked at the home several days in their excellent kitchen and enjoyed our meals both inside and outside. At night, our girls went star gazing outside with great views of the sky and almost no light noise inhibiting their view. It was a place where we made lifetime memories and we were so thankful to have picked it on Airbnb. We would stay here again in a heartbeat.",

She was very respectful of our privacy but was very responsive to our requests for things like a hose to wash off our bikes. This was a beautiful stop along the way … highly recommend!",

Look for the “slowdown kids at play”  green man holding a flag. The drive starts right beside him. \n\n\nThe setting, the large spacious room and the front porch were constantly inviting us to stay and relax so we did.   Mornings were coffee on the porch with Donna and evening  was wine and cheese while watching sunset.\n\nSince we were staying there  to attend the Contemporary Theater Arts Festival the 5 minute drive from the University and Sheppardstown, made Donna’s place ideally located for us to return and refresh between\nshows.\n\nEverything from the sofa and bed , the fridge and microwave and the views from the windows combined to show the care Donna has taken to provide her guest with an amazing and warm home away from home.\n\nWe will be making reservations to be with her again whenever we are in that area.",

During our stay, our family spent time visiting the abundant wineries and breweries within close proximity to Hillsboro.  The scenic drive around Loudoun County is absolutely beautiful!

It is a cozy mother-in-law suite, perfect for one or two people. Immaculately clean and super cutely decorated, I felt at home immediately.  This was helped by the fact that Jimmie, the ranch owner is so friendly and helpful. Ask for the tour, pet the \"divas\", the donkey and the dogs, who are all friendly.  There are even a couple of kitties around.  The bed was perfect for me, firm, not hard and lots of pillows.  All in all, charming, cozy and peaceful.  Thanks again to Jimmie and his wife for their hospitality.  I'm sure I'll be back again.  👍😁",

A little bottle of sparkling wine, fresh tomatoes, and chocolate by the night stand was an unexpected treat! Looking for a safe place to spend a night away from the crowds. I highly suggest Jimmie and Jackie’s.",

This house feels like a home with thoughtful decor, including amazing art from the talented hosts, and a well-appointed kitchen. The grounds are also very well cared for and a great space for sitting out with a book on a sunny day. The hosts were helpful and responsive if needed and provided several resources to help make the most of the local area.",

An entertainment center bursting with classic DVD movies.

  "description": {
    "summary": "This beautifully furnished cottage on three acres is in the heart of Hunt Country and  Appalachian foothills. We are near the picturesque village of The Plains, VA., eight miles south of Middleburg and 50 miles west of DC. Renovated thoughtfully, it retains its charm and 19th century stone foundation. The fully equipped kitchen and dining room have an open plan while the sunroom opens to a large deck overlooking the expansive lawn. Please read our reviews and plan your perfect getaway!",
    "space": "We have T-Mobile high speed internet at 25-50 meg per second. The base is located near the sunroom. The password is in our guidebook, on our website, and on the bulletin board in the main floor bedroom",
    "access": "You will have the entire house and, of course, the deck and the large lawn along with the use of the grill and fire pit. The basement is to be used for laundry purposes only and is off-limits to children. The barn will be available soon for artists to use as a studio. Although we provide sleeping for eight, we recommend no more than six adults, since the cottage rooms could feel tight if everyone is gathered in one room (especially when the deck cannot be used due to weather). Please note that pricing is for two and extras are $20 per person per night).",
    "notes": "Our base price is listed above, but we do charge $20 per person per night for additional guests after the first two. Children under 2 are free. We are not too far from the road so we expect that children and dogs will be watched. \n\nThe kitchen cupboards have some staples and spices, oils, etc. In the refrigerator, you'll find condiments, salad dressings, etc. Feel free to use something if you need it and leave unopened items if you'd like. In the bathroom medicine cabinets you will find some necessities, so if you need a bandaid or a tums or ibuprofen, you won't need to run to the store for that little thing you forgot. \n\nPlease note that we do have a security camera covering the driveway and a bit of the yard since the property is not our primary residence and is not always occupied. Also, we ask the person who books to first agree to our house rules since, in booking, they agree to them. We do not prohibit alcohol, but we ask that groups who are coming to binge drink and party heavily to please book elsewhere.\n\nWe have high speed internet, about 250 movies, two DVD players, and satellite tv (in the living room).\n\nIn the very back south-east corner of the property, in the woods down in a ditch is an area where people used to put glass and metal. Although it is hard to get to, please be aware and stay clear.",
    "neighborhood": "The location of the property is ideal for hiking (close to the Appalachian Trail), biking, and horseback riding. Artists will appreciate the rolling hills, historic architecture and miles of old stone fences. Enjoy the many surrounding wineries (you can use Uber if needed), antiquing, orchards and farm-to-table dining establishments nearby, or pack a picnic basket (yes, we have two available at the house) and enjoy \"Twilight Polo\" every Saturday evening throughout the summer in The Plains at Great Meadow where the VA Cup steeplechases are held annually. Enjoy the farmer's market in The Plains each Sunday spring to fall. Horse (self) boarding and horseback riding lessons are possible across the street at Madcap Farm. Fishing, ice skating, pavilions, walking/biking paths, and sports fields are all available literally a minute down the road at Northern Fauquier County Community Park. History buffs will enjoy seeing Civil War battlefields in the area. For spa ladies, the Salamander Resort is about ten miles to the north.\nThe area has an interesting assortment of country folks and, well... very wealthy country folks! You'll find artists, farmers, and even a few celebrities. Horses neighing or roosters crowing in the distance will remind you that it is time to relax and take in the country air.",
    "transit": "You will need a car since we are in the country. However, two small towns are within two miles in each direction and two larger towns are within 10 miles. Washington DC is 50 miles to our east. This is a world-class biking area, so you may want to bring your bike and helmet! We are told Uber is easily available if you prefer not to drive.",
    "interaction": "We may not always be there to greet you, but we are always a text or phone call away! It is best to contact us by our cell phones - in house manual or on our website, foxcrosscottage.com.",
    "house_rules": "Upon booking, guests agree to the Fox Cross Cottage house Agreement:\n\nThe rental party shall consist of the Guest (person booking the house) and only those persons listed in airbnb/Vrbo. \n\nCHECK-IN 3pm (or after), CHECK-OUT is by 11am (unless otherwise offered by the Homeowner).\n\nBy renting, the Rental Party agrees to abide by the following rules:\n\n1.

We have a two-dog maximum and reserve the right to reject any pet for any reason. We assume no liability for any animal brought to the property and recommend keeping dogs on-leash outside since the house is not far from the road. Dogs may sit on the soft furniture but we ask that Guests lay a towel down (we can provide extras) or use the dog bed provided. If extra cleaning is required after the visit, it may reflect on the Guest's review/deposit. We ask that dogs be crated if left alone in the house (we can provide a medium-sized crate). Well-behaved dogs may be left in the sunroom using the baby gate in the doorway. Waste should be carried to the fence, tree line, or compost pile (not left on the lawn).\n\nCANCELLATION and SECURITY DEPOSIT information is listed on the Airbnb platform. Please note that we have two security cameras outside since Fox Cross Cottage is not our primary residence.\n\nThank you for choosing Fox Cross Cottage!",

The place was very spacious, modern, and comfortable. \nWe live in DC, and so we booked this place for our kids (ages 5 and 17 months) to get some fresh air and to be outside. My kids adored looking at the animals. Within an hour of getting there, my five year old had made friends with a couple cats and was just sitting peacefully playing with them in the yard. She would have spent the entire weekend just doing that!\nBarb is just so sweet and makes this stay extra special! She and Scott raise exotic birds. During our time there they had emus, rheas and nenes!  There is a trail around the farm so you can see some of the animals that aren’t near the yard too. \nMy daughter asked me multiple times why we were only staying two nights and couldn’t we just move there?\nSimply could not be any better!",

    "summary": "The Cuckoo Chalet is our happy place and a labor of love. We purchased the chalet as a broken-down foreclosure and spent two years bringing it back to life. Come and stay \"just up the mountain\" from historic Harper's Ferry National Park.\n\nEnjoy two bedrooms with queen beds and a third bedroom with two twin trundle beds and an extra queen mattress. Grill on the deck, roast s'mores at the fire pit, watch for deer, hike nearby trails, hang out playing pool or just read a good book in the hammock.",
    "space": "See more on The Cuckoo Chalet online at the 'book of faces'.",
    "access": "For now, there is no access to the laundry room. We hope to eventually have a wall so we can separate the laundry from the garage and allow access. Please excuse the wait.",
    "notes": "Allergy Alert: When we visit the chalet, we bring our cat.\n\nThere are deer outside and so you should prepare against ticks - wear hats and bug spray.",
    "neighborhood": "The Cuckoo Chalet is \"just up the mountain\" from historic Harper's Ferry National Park and very close to the Shenandoah and Potomac Rivers. Our family loves to spend time at nearby River Riders (riverriders.com) for tubing, kayaking, canoeing, paddle-boarding, white-water rafting, high adventure rope courses and zip-lining. There is also a pocket of the Shenandoah River nearby, which we refer to as our swimming hole. Use at your own risk.\n\nThe Cuckoo Chalet is very close to Virginia wine country with countless vineyards and even near several distilleries. Bring a picnic to Breaux Vineyards on a weekend and feel like you are in Napa! Or visit local distilleries for a moonshine tasting! There is horseback riding, antiquing and flea markets, as well as are quaint farmer's markets, fresh fruit and vegetable stands and roadside barbecue wagons.\n\nThe Cuckoo Chalet is less than a mile from the Appalachian Trail and four miles from the C&O Canal. It is a short drive to Hollywood Casino and Slots which also features horse-racing and big name entertainment. We love the hometown feel of the Old Opera House in Charlestown for a weekend night out. The Chalet is also just a short ride to charming Shepardstown with cute shops and restaurants. If you are headed to Antietam Battlefield, remember to stop at the amazing Nutter's Ice Cream Parlor in Sharpsburg.\n\nThere are plenty of shopping and basic restaurant choices in nearby Ranson, just a ten-minute ride away.",
    "house_rules": "The Cuckoo Chalet has an outdoor camera security system. Please do not attempt to bring any pets or extra guests who have not been registered, unless you want to lose your security deposit.\n\nPlease remove your shoes in the cabin.\n\nIf you use the fire pit, please pour water on it when you are finished to make sure the fire has been put out.\n\nPlease follow check-out procedures listed on bulletin board in main hallway.",

The house is set at the entrance to a property has 11 acres, the Main house is 1000 feet away. You will feel very private, the porch has a pretty view of country side.  We have 3 tenants that live further down the road and there is a barn.

The farm is rural and yet only six minutes from town. We appreciated the restaurant suggestions. \nWould stay again in a heartbeat!",

Forests are my playgrounds.  Our young adult children help and that is the best!  Frederick, MD is a favorite place on this planet to eat, walk, talk with shop owners and artists, and attend Quaker Meeting for Worship.  This precious part of Maryland is a wonderful place to visit and live.",

It is close to so many things you never heard of (Weverton Cliffs, the silver cup-a 100 year old abbitoir turned into a restaurant, a great nature center where your kids can feel what corn snakes feel like, breweries and coffee shops in old churches, and all of this is not to mention whatever you discover on the farm).

    "summary": "Beautiful countryside vistas, nature-lover's paradise,  feels like you are far away, yet the fine food and art of Frederick are only a 15 minute drive up the road.  Hikes, Harper's Ferry, Ski Liberty, or just the quiet of our bucolic setting await.  It can be a part of a larger retreat when combined with 2 other houses on the farm, and a restored Dairy Parlor. However, we can not hold weddings due to county zoning. We can have rehearsal dinners and other events though.  You can join a class too.",
    "space": "Chestnut House is a part of Fox Haven - a historic organic farm and non-profit ecological education center located along the Catoctin Creek in Jefferson, Maryland, within one hour of Washington D.C. and Baltimore, and 15 minutes from the charming town of Frederick, MD.  Chestnut House is a restored early 19th century farmhouse cradled by beautiful rolling hills on a gravel country road. A creek gurgles in the front yard, woods loaded with birds, and a chestnut orchard are on the other three sides of the house.  A big red barn - no animals -  and re-purposed dairy parlor also sit on the property.  The house has a large kitchen with double oven, lots of counter space, and a big farm kitchen table for all to share.  There are two large rooms downstairs, bay window and fireplace, the other with plenty of space to stretch out for some yoga and board games.  The front porch is wide and lovely, a perfect place to relax and enjoy the peace.  Walking trails and the country road provide breathtaking views, birds of all sorts, and the Catoctin Creek is home to big blue herons, eagles, beaver, and plenty of rich plant life - a feast for the senses!  Antiques, civil war history, rock climbing, canoeing along the Potomac or Shenandoah Rivers, minor league baseball, art studios, outlet shopping, mountain biking and so much more are all within 15-20 minutes of the house. Plenty of wineries, cideries, and distilleries are within 10-30 minutes away. The farm office is inside the house, so the phone will ring occasionally, thought we try to turn the ringer off when guests are here. If we are holding classes out in the barn, you will see other folks around.  Check in with us to see what is happening the weekend of your stay. You might want to join in the fun. Your stay supports farm programs that we offer children and adults from low income communities, people suffering with PTSD, and other life challenges.",
    "access": "You have use of the entire house.  Country gravel roads to walk, woods and streams to explore, a big porch where you can relax and observe nature, are all accessible to guests.",
    "notes": "We are a retreat center and occasionally offer experiences: wild food forage, garden tour. & tea tasting, herb classes, tree grafting classes, beekeeping 101 and honey tasting, etc...that you can join.  You can arrange in advance for a group of 8 or more to have your own class dependent on staff availability.",
    "neighborhood": "Chestnut House sits along a gravel country road surrounded by fields, woods, and streams.  There are a few houses up the road, but you are unlikely to see many people - mostly wildlife.  Places to eat within a 5 minute drive include Ingram's Diner, an ice cream and sandwich cafe, Jefferson Pastry Shop, and Watsons chicken carry out.  There is a small grocery in town, but a Safeway in Middletown or the Common Market and other grocery stores are in Frederick and will offer more options.  The Appalachian Trail is a short drive (15-20 minutes) and offers great hiking and rock climbing.  Bicyclists love it out here! Harper's Ferry is about a 15-20 minute drive and there's plenty of history, whitewater rafting and tubing, and quaint shops and flea markets to explore.  Frederick offers an abundance of restaurants, art galleries, shops, live entertainment, museums, parks, and a triple A baseball team to watch.  Brunswick is a great place to hop on the C&O bike path, grab some coffee and a homemade meal at Beans in the Belfry.  There are many artists in the Middletown Valley, as well as historic sites to explore.",
    "transit": "The metrorail system offers the MARC train from Washington D.C. and Reagan National airport to Frederick and Brunswick. One must take a cab from there to Chestnut House.  Sometimes you can catch a shuttle from Dulles airport to Frederick where you then take a cab to Chestnut House.",
    "interaction": "The owner has very little interaction with the guests. Basically a welcome and then you are on your own. However, we are a working farm and occasionally have outdoor classes that meet in the barn or Dairy Parlor.  We are always available by phone and are nearby if needed.",
    "house_rules": "We ask that guests leave the house and grounds clean; dishes put in dishwasher and run, all towels and sheets put in laundry room, trash and recycling in cans when you leave.  There is no smoking.  We ask that guests follow the directions if you want to use the woodstove and/or fire place - we leave directions at the house. Please do not try to adjust heat/central air register.  Ideally, the less plastic used the better. The water is good filtered well water.  You are welcome to have more people sleep on the couches or floor, just indicate how many folks will stay at the house when signing up.",

The views were serene. The Native American influence was all through the home and truly an experience.",

Well written directions and easy access made check in and out a breeze!\n\nWater pressure in shower/tub was low and remained low even after the host tried to fix. She was very responsive to my complaint. Additionally, shower head is not mounted making it difficult to shower. \n\nWiFi is slow but that’s not why you’re staying here! Ultimately, it was a great value and a pleasant stay. Thanks Ginny!",

There were plenty of amenities including a regular drip coffee maker with coffee, plenty of towels/pillows, shampoo/conditioner and bar soap (no shower gel), a nice working gas grill, a huge dining room table, kitchen table, and an extremely well-stocked kitchen.  The beds were comfortable and the sheets were soft.  The master bedroom was expansive.  Just a note, closets are not available so hanging up clothes is very limited.  We already had plans for the weekend so did not ask for recommendations although it sounds like Alina was ready to assist.  Alina was very attentive, called beforehand to provide instructions, and thanked us after departing.  It’s a wonderful and comfortable house that we would be more than happy to stay at again.",

We (four couples) celebrated a \"cousins birthday weekend\" - we arrived on Friday and never left the property until we checked out on Monday.  The kitchen is abundantly equipped to accommodate large meals (we cooked for 8), but several wonderful restaurants are close by.   The bedrooms are chic, bathrooms are comfortable, and the living areas are perfect for movie nights, reading, or board games.  We spent mornings outside on the large decks, in the garden, on the sitting porch.  Pack a bottle of wine and settle in ... Alina's 'Hydrangea Farm' is a sensational escape to the good life.",

We felt very much at home bringing in packages and watering her new spring sprouts.\n\nThe bedrooms are very tastefully decorated and she provided shampoo, soap, more than enough towels and pillows.  The only complaint in the sleeping areas was all the closets are locked and there is no place to hang clothes.  Over the door hooks could be used while still locking personal items.\n\nThe living spaces and kitchen were huge and beautiful.  Dining room table sat 14 for dinner.  The deck off the kitchen is convenient and welcoming with a fire pit and outdoor furniture.  \n\nThe property was worth the value if only for the 5 bedrooms and 4 baths!  But it is a warm home with office space and 3 coffee makers!",

The location, along the Potomac, is fantastic. We wanted a quiet, rural getaway and that’s exactly what we found.",

It's filled with period antiques and decor along with the necessary modern touches.  Visiting Gayfield is a rare opportunity to stay in a home that has been much-loved by the few families who have lived here.  The view from every window is stunning and you can really step back in time, imagining the bustling activity that took place on this farm.  If you are a history seeker, you couldn't find a better spot than here to do your research from the 17th century to the present.  Visit the Heritage Frederick Museum, the Maryland Room at the C. Burr Artz Library, and the Monacacy Visitor's Center, just to name a few amazing resource spots, where you will be welcomed as I was.",

    "summary": "Welcome to the Farmers Suite on the 3rd floor of the Manor House!  The Farmer's Suite is very private, situated with a bedroom with a full size bed, a comfortable sofa bed in the great room and affords views in three directions of the farm.  With modern heating and air conditioning, an adorable claw-foot tub/shower, and a kitchenette with appliances the Suite is comfortable and charming.  There are headroom limitations so this Suite is not for the super tall!",
    "access": "Upon entering the front door of the Manor House you'll find a large foyer.  All guests have shared access to the Common Area, Greenhouse, and Common Area full Kitchen (with range/oven) on the 1st floor as shown in the pictures.  Please do not disturb the fish in the greenhouse, and remember the area is shared so please clean up after use.  \n\nThere are multiple Suites in the home, but each is separate and secure.  \n\nThere is an 850 yard long path down to the large Monocacy River which borders the East edge of the farm.  There is about 1500 ft of river frontage, but it's not really possible to manicure the river bank so you'll need to work your way down to the water as if you were in the wild if you'd like to fish or launch a kayak.\n\nCurrently several animals from D&D's Petting Zoo and Pony Rides are boarded at the farm and include ponies, a zebra, a miniature donkey, goats and other such critters.  The animals are very friendly!\n\nIn support of the global effort to conserve energy resources utilizing reasonable practices, we use a maximum heating setting of 71 degrees and a minimum cooling setting of 72 degrees.",
    "notes": "The Manor House at Gayfield was originally built in 1850 by the Jarboe family, and currently sits upon 144 acres of farmland in Central Frederick County.  The farm has had three owners, currently owned by the Bartlett family and before them the Morans and the Jarboes.  Thomas Jarboe served as a County Commissioner in the 1800's and William \"Bill\" Moran was a world-famous knifesmith.\n\nThe Jarboe family commissioned a major addition in 1895 when the Northwest turret, 4 rooms on the Southeast side, and the stone water tower were added. So the Jarboe family had 'running' water in the 1800's, which was rare at the time.\n\nAlthough the house has been modified over the last nearly 200 years , all of the wood floors throughout the house date from 1850 and in some rooms 1895, and nearly all of the woodwork dates to the same periods.",

I have 2 permanent tenants and they have their own bedrooms and bathrooms.\n\nWe actually gets water from our own well in the backyard. That’s why the water (mainly hot water) is a bit pale color. It’s due to the iron in the well water. We have a water treatment filter installed in the basement to reduce the iron in the water. There is nothing wrong with the water except for the discoloration.",

We liked that the house was far enough out of town that our stay was peaceful and quiet but also close enough to town that we could make a quick trip to town for a bite to eat or to shop when needed. We look forward to staying at Joe's place again in the future.",

It's in a quiet, historic family home and farm with mementos of the Congressman's service to the Sixth District.  We arrived on a gray, misty evening and were thankful to see the porch lights in the fog.  The sun came out the next morning, and we loved the goats and mini-horses, also the tropical plants in the atrium of the house.  instructions were clear and easy to follow.  Keyless check-in was very good. Although there were many vehicles parked around the other buildings, we saw almost no one. The wireless internet was fast and a great connection. The room temperature was perfect in December, and the shower water was hot.  We would gladly stay here again! We recommend this for anyone with a sense of adventure.",

What a very relaxing place to read a book!!\n\nI  one of the upstairs communal spaces there’s a padded  reading bench perfectly situated in the window. \n\nAdditionally, the historically significance \nstay comes with roaming petting zoo animals. All of the animals were super duper friendly and weren’t afraid of a loud seven year old.  \n\nAs far as accommodations - The rooms are spacious and clean. The mattresses are comfortable. The microwave and hot plates are more than we needed. It was a very relaxing, family-friendly getaway location.",

    "summary": "Welcome to the Scientist's Suite!  On the 2nd floor of the Manor House, the Suite is situated with a full size bed in the great room and a separate bedroom with another full size bed that provides a view down the long driveway of the farm.  With modern heating and air conditioning, vintage full bath, and an original drain-board sink with kitchenette appliances, the Suite is comfortable and efficient.  This was the bedroom of Roscoe Bartlett, PhD, a former researcher and medical school professor.",
    "access": "Upon entering the front door of the Manor House you'll find a large foyer.  All guests have shared access to the Common Area, Greenhouse, and Common Area full Kitchen (with range/oven) on the 1st floor as shown in the pictures.  Please do not disturb the fish in the greenhouse, and remember the area is shared so please clean up after use.  \n\nThere are multiple Suites in the home, but each is separate and secure.  \n\nThere is an 850 yard long path down to the large Monocacy River which borders the East edge of the farm.  There is about 1500 ft of river frontage, but it's not really possible to manicure the river bank so you'll need to work your way down to the water as if you were in the wild if you'd like to fish or launch a kayak.\n\nCurrently several animals from D&D's Petting Zoo and Pony Rides are boarded at the farm and include ponies, a zebra, a miniature donkey, goats and other such critters.  The animals are very friendly!\n\nIn support of the global effort to conserve energy resources utilizing reasonable practices, we use a maximum heating setting of 72 degrees and a minimum cooling setting of 72 degrees.",
    "notes": "The Manor House at Gayfield Estate was originally built in 1850 by the Jarboe family, and currently sits upon 144 acres of farmland in Central Frederick County.  The farm has had three owners, currently owned by the Bartlett family and before them the Morans and the Jarboes.  Thomas Jarboe served as a County Commissioner in the 1800's and William \"Bill\" Moran was a world-famous knifesmith.\n\nThe Jarboe family commissioned a major addition in 1895 when the Northwest turret, 4 rooms on the Southeast side, and the stone water tower were added. So the Jarboe family had 'running' water in the 1800's, which was rare at the time.\n\nAlthough the house has been modified over the last nearly 200 years , all of the wood floors throughout the house date from 1850 and in some rooms 1895, and nearly all of the woodwork dates to the same periods.",

This farm holds so many fond memories and life experiences for generations of Cassidys. I love being outside, whether it's outdoor recreation, raising cattle, or working in the vegetable garden. There is nothing better than taking home-grown food out of the garden and whipping up an amazing meal for family and friends.  Yes, I do love to cook!  \r\n\r\nIt may sound like I never leave the farm, but my wife and I love to travel whether its halibut fishing in Alaska, horse-back trips in Montana, sitting on the beach in Grand Cayman, or taking the grandkids to Disney World.\r\n\r\nI have spent a lifetime growing things, and  connecting with nature. One of my great joys is to share some of that knowlege and experience with other folks.\r\n\r\n",

    "summary": "Quaint country apartment on 110 acre vegetable and cattle farm, in the heart of Northern Virginia wine country. Imagine, stepping out your door, picking fresh veges and cooking your own Farm to Table Meal. Secluded with fantastic views of the Blue Ridge mountains. Big discounts for longer stays.",
    "space": "Lovely 1200 square foot 1 bedroom apartment above a three car detatched garage. Has a private locked entrance. Quiet and secluded, a great place to escape and relax. Lawn chairs and a fire pit for somores, or just gazing at the incredible night sky. Close to some great wineries and craft breweries.",
    "access": "You will have the whole apartment and surrounding grounds to yourself. There is a fire ring near apartment so feel free to sit around a fire and roast marshmallows or enjoy a glass of wine. Or just sit outside and gaze at the stars!",
    "notes": "The unit comes with strong wi-fi but does not have a tv. Watch the wildlife, and enjoy nature.",
    "neighborhood": "The apartment is located in an idyllic setting with beautiful views all around us.  We are close to great biking, hiking, rafting, tubing, fishing, outdoor festivals and concerts, antique shops, vineyards, local microbreweries, historic civil war sites, pick-your-own fruit and vegetable farms and much, much more. We are approximately a 50-minute drive to Shenandoah National Park, Skyline Drive, and Luray Caverns and about a 20-minute drive to the scenic and historic Harper's Ferry. Don't be surprised to see lots of wildlife like deer, wild turkey, eagles, herons, and many other species of birds.",
    "transit": "You will pass sections of the beautiful Shenandoah river to get in and out of our property. Our farm is accessed via two miles of gravel road so please don't think you have taken a wrong turn when the road becomes gravel.  It is an excellent road and driveway and is accessible for any type of car.  Plenty of parking.",
    "interaction": "Need us, we are close by; don't need us, you may not even see us.  We are friendly and like sharing information about the local area but we are not pesky (i.e., intrusive).",

The house has beautifully decorated interiors, and the room was exactly as described. I had an amazing view. The dogs are very friendly, and I loved interacting with the farm animals, especially the horses. \n\nNorma and Patrick went above and beyond as hosts. They were very friendly, considerate and accommodating while giving me the space I needed as a guest. The were flexible and understanding when I had to change my move in time last minute. Patrick expanded on farm life with clear interest, and patiently engaged with my many questions about the animals and the general area. Norma very graciously offered me a warm jacket on a particularly windy day, as I was walking outside to sit by the pond. \n\nI am definitely returning to stay here. Norma and Patrick--thank you for making me feel at home during my stay!",

We did not partake in the breakfast, but it was available and sounded amazing.  I will without a doubt stay here again when we return.  As a former resident of the area, I had no idea this existed and it is definitely a gem. Again I can not say enough positive.",

This property is pristine. Just immaculately clean and well kept. There was so much care put into the beautiful decor and lovely personal touches like the oil painting of the owners beautiful golden retrievers whom you will no doubt meet during your stay. The house was stocked with essentials, toiletries, snacks. etc. We enjoyed the gas fireplace while hanging out in the living area. The bed was like a cloud with the softest sheets! Tiffany has done an excellent job. She was communicating the entire time ensuring that we had everything we needed. We met her dad, Bob who greeted us.  He was so friendly and gave us a great restaurant recommendation. Overall 10 out 10 and we would not only book again but will recommend to others coming to the area.",

She was very responsive to a handful of questions we had and check-in/out was seamless. Our baby loved meeting Spotify, the farm’s pony!\n\nA couple notes for anyone looking to stay: dogs on property will definitely greet you (very friendly, but in case of allergies), no curtains in the bedroom as it’s English-basement style (important if you’re light-sensitive), HVAC controls are outside the unit (Tiffany very helpful in getting adjusted).",

This place has been such a blessing to us - the peaceful walks down to the creek,  the amazing neighbors, the stunning wildlife, splitting wood in the summer, cozy fires in the winter, ahhh... We have put so much work and love into the cabin over the years - we restored the logs, renovated the kitchen and loft, and much more.  We hope you too will have the opportunity to create your own memories and enjoy the peace and quiet away from all the noise! Let us know if you have any questions!",

    "summary": "*A perfect escape, close to home! Perfect family getaway!* Endearing log cabin, perfect for anyone looking to getaway. Nestled on five, beautiful acres of land just minutes walk from the Appalachian Trail and creek; and just minutes drive from nearest winery.\nRustic, authentic, Appalachian style log cabin with vaulted ceilings, loft, pot belly wood stove, and three quaint bedrooms.",
    "space": "Master (queen) bedroom has own bathroom with large claw foot tub and separate shower. Second bedroom (king) is a huge inviting loft with bright skylights and sliding barn door for privacy. Third bedroom (twin) is simple, but cozy. Kitchen has everything you need for your stay including pots, pans, utensils, coffee maker, toaster, and more. Back deck overlooks open acre of gently sloping land. \n\nYou will want to see this place in every season: Spring brings stunning colors from Forsythia, Red Buds, wild Lillies, and the native mountain flower, Trillium. Experience the dense mountain fog and the nearby peaceful streams and creeks! Our cabin is surrounded by beautiful, enormous poplar trees full of character and shade to complement the cool mountain breeze. Summers on the mountain are an escape from the hot city and are noticeably cooler as you drive up the mountain. Find a hammock and let yourself relax. Winters offer unusual snowfall compared to the bottom of the mountain. In the winter you can watch the sunrise through the trees from the deck or just let the amber light shine through the cabin windows and make a warm cup of coffee, tea, or hot cocoa, bring your favorite book and get cozy next to the pot belly wood stove!",
    "access": "Entire cabin and 5+ acres of outdoor space.",
    "notes": "We have increased our cleaning regimen during these uncertain times. We are taking extra care to disinfect frequently touched surfaces between reservations in addition to thorough cleaning of all bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchen, and living spaces. Linens are washed in hot water.",
    "neighborhood": "Fox Meadow is conveniently only a few miles away and offers a stunning view from their open deck or tasting room. Chester Gap will exceed your expectations with a great selection of wine, cozy tasting room, friendly atmosphere, and unparalleled view of the gap in Front Royal. Front Royal Brewery offers great food, live music, and of course, great beer inspired by the local community flavor. Stop on your way up the mountain at The Giving Tree and pick up some last minute items; fresh bread, wine, local produce, milk and eggs. Locals rave about The Apple House. Visit Shenandoah National Park, less than a half hour away. Explore the nearby caverns or Shenandoah River by kayak, just 20 minutes away. Take in the views from Skyline Drive within a beautiful 30 minute drive from the property. There is so much more to see and do. Book with us and come see what this charming area has to offer!",
    "transit": "A vehicle is a must. We are located on top of Blue Mountain in a quiet, secluded, community tucked away in the woods. Road conditions can vary depending on the weather. We recommend bringing all groceries that you will need/want for your stay, as the nearest store is a 20 minute drive from the cabin and once you arrive,  you just won't want to leave!  We believe that this is one of the many appeals to this lovely destination; peace and quiet. Enjoy!",
    "interaction": "We are available by phone, text, or email and if needed can be accessible in person most times.",

    "summary": "This listing is adults only.  Mt. Mama Meadows Homestead is our own slice of “almost Heaven”. We're located in Harpers Ferry, a small historic town in Jefferson County, West Virginia, in the lower Shenandoah Valley. Whether you are coming to check out the surrounding Blue Ridge Mountains, hike the Appalachian Trail, raft the Potomac or Shenandoah rivers, delve into the rich Civil War history of the area, or just relax on the homestead, there is no shortage of things to do.",
    "space": "This listing is adults only. NO GUEST ANIMALS PERMITTED. This is a working homestead and biosecurity is a great concern. \n\nThink studio apartment located on a real homestead!   There is high speed wifi to accommodate remote working or school. When you arrive, there is 1 dedicated, paved parking spot.  Don't worry if bringing 2 vehicles, there is plenty of room, it's just not paved.\n\nThe space is 1 large, lodge style, studio apartment room with a private bathroom.  It's attached to our main house and separated by a single, dead bolted door internally.  The entrance is private and equipped with a keyless entry. We have white noise machines on both sides of the single door that attaches us. \n\nIt is furnished with a café style, 2-seater table, small couch, dresser, and 2 nightstands - each with a wireless charging equipped lamp.  There is a well appointed kitchenette and outdoor propane grill.  The complimentary wine bar is best enjoyed while spending the evening under the stars, relaxing on your private deck, or around your private, real wood fire pit. Retire for the night to the comfy, queen size bed. There is a complimentary coffee and tea bar, stocked with  locally roasted coffee. In the morning, enjoy a cuppa while watching the animals roam the fields from your private deck or look out over the front yard while rocking on your private front porch.   \n\nYou may walk around the homestead and interact with many of the animals at your leisure.  Please use caution! All fenced in areas contain electric fencing and it is always HOT. Treats for all of the animals are provided in labeled containers in your room.  Please do not feed the  animals any treats outside of the ones provided because they have very specific diets. \n\nThis is a working homestead. While we try to stay quiet, sometimes nature has other plans. Also, we mostly free range our chickens and rooster (weather permitting) so be mindful of their location.  Our roos job is to protect his flock and he does it well.\n\nOur homestead is ever growing and changing as we have only owned it since October 31, 2019. \n\nBe mindful that we are located in the country and have UV treated well water.  Please be conservative with your water use.  While we have installed a brand new pump and extra large pressure tank, the main house and 2 airbnb's each have their own hot water tanks and water pressure may vary from time to time as the whole homestead runs off a single well that can only pump so many gallons per minute.  Pressure is adequate but if super high pressure showers is something you require, you may want to book elsewhere.\n\nPlease note that aside from the Lodge Room and our main home, we also have a 2nd Airbnb on the homestead, the \"Homestead Hideaway\" .  There is plenty of room on our 13.6 acre homestead and outside areas are situated to be very private.\n\nNot responsible for power loss.\n\nWhile we do our best to keep them away in conjunction with our local pest control company, we can not control nature, and the home is older so we do experience seasonal bugs like everyone else.\n\nOur homestead is ever growing and changing as we have only owned it since October 31, 2019.  \n\nWe can not guarantee what animals will or won't be here at the time of your visit.",
    "notes": "This listing is adults only (18+). NO GUEST ANIMALS PERMITTED. This is a working homestead and biosecurity is a great concern.",
    "neighborhood": "Our place is close to Historic Harpers Ferry National Park, Shepherdstown, and Antietam. With wineries galore, the Shenandoah and Potomac rivers, the Appalachian Trail system, Hollywood casino, art and culture, restaurants and dining all within a short drive, there is never a shortage of things to do.\n\nYou may hear and see animals of all types, both domestic & wild. Deer are everywhere so be careful when driving. We have a fair amount of birds including lots of songbirds, owls, hawks and even resident bald eagles. We are off the main road just a bit so the side roads do get a little dicey in the winter.  Please check local weather before traveling.",
    "transit": "A car is required. Public transportation is non-existent in this area.  Uber and Lyft do come out here but it takes forever.  Great restaurants are just 10 minutes away.  Bring your bicycles for riding on rural roads & the C&O Canal NHP towpath.  The only thing within walking distance is our little town market, Bakerton Market. You can walk or jog on the rural roads, just be careful to do so facing traffic.",
    "interaction": "The hosts live  in the main house, which is separated by a dead bolted door internally. The Airbnb unit has a separate entrance with keyless entry opening out to the front yard and parking. The hosts work full-time but are available for any needed repairs, local knowledge/suggestions, or assistance in making your stay more comfortable.",

The only aspect that could be improved is the wireless network, as for some reason it would unpredictably lose connectivity.  Because the wireless network was unreliable, a personal hotspot was used through a cellular connection.  Overall very pleased with the cottage and will stay there again whenever possible.",

It has high ceilings, excellent light, and lovely views. The  experience is fully private.  Even though the host's family lives in the main house, we were completely unaware of any of their living activities.\n\nOlivia provided detailed directions and check-in instructions, and when we arrived there was additional information about the house itself.  She was also flexible about rescheduling part of our trip shortly after we had booked it.\n\nI would recommend this house to anyone.  It would make a fantastic romantic getaway, but it was also great for our family group.  While the property feels very remote, the nearest town is about a 7 minute drive.",

The house is well decorated, well kept, and beautifully laid out. The grounds are simply gorgeous, grassy pastures, great trees, rolling hills, and no noise or distractions whatsoever.

As you approach the main home, you will pass the courtyard horse stables. The original stone house dates back to the 1800s and an addition created a large, modern and open kitchen with a formal dining room, formal living room, and spacious theater room with a large wine cellar.  \n\nThe kitchen opens up onto an outdoor covered patio with a large dining table and chairs overlooking the expansive gardens and stone walls. From there, you can enjoy access to the attached sun room, complete with ceiling fans, stone walls, and a comfortable lounging sectional. The sunroom’s doors open out to the back lawns and pool as well as into the formal indoor dining room, which boasts a wood-burning fireplace. \n\nThe living room opens onto the back patio and offers views into the front and back gardens with towering oak trees. This Restoration Hardware room is equipped with a gas fireplace, setting a perfect tone for morning coffee or cozy evenings. \n\nThe library has views of the horse paddocks and front gardens and faces the front walkways and front door and offers a small couch, desk, flatscreen TV, and wood-burning fireplace. \n\nAttached to the library is a large office and gym space offering a mudroom, a half bath and another side entrance door. There are two staircases leading upstairs, where you will find the spacious master suite with attached bath, a separate large Roman spa tub and shower, a lounge room, and the laundry room.\n\nUpstairs there are also four guest bedrooms that share two fully renovated bathrooms between them. Two bedrooms offer stunning views of the pool and gardens, and the other two bedrooms offer sweeping views of the scenic front horse pastures and lawns.\n\nYou may have as much or as little interaction with the horses onsite as you would like. There are plenty of opportunities for horse petting and carrot-feeding.",
    "access": "Guests will have full access to estate, to include main house, pool, gardens, outdoor spaces, outdoor kitchen cabana, hiking trails.",

    "interaction": "I’ll be staying offsite but nearby to help with any concerns.",

The vistas of field and farm were so nice - sitting on the patio one afternoon we saw a doe and her fawn leaping across the field in front of us. We walked down the mowed path to the creek (with all three goats following us) and enjoyed swimming in the creek and hanging out with the goats on the pebbled beach. Melinda was terrific whenever we had any questions, gave us tips on what to see in town, and also gave us maximum privacy, which was exactly what we wanted. Perhaps the best part of all (for my civil war buff husband) was the stellar location, which is within easy drives of Shepherdstown, Antietam, Harper's Ferry, and Winchester, all of which we visited. A great place to stay in the country!",

We offer garden tours and tea tastings, nature walks and beekeeping 101 with a honey tasting to groups of at least 8.  This is dependent upon staff availability.  We have 2 other farm houses and a restored Dairy Parlor available for larger retreats.  Your stay supports farm programs that we offer children and adults from low income communities, people suffering with PTSD, and other life challenges.",
    "access": "The house is entirely yours to enjoy. There are trails on the farm and a beautiful gravel road where Catoctin and Lewis creeks flow where you can walk/bike. Strolls along the gravel road along the Catoctin creek, birding, and just relaxing away from electronic and work distractions are what folks enjoy most about Fox Haven Organic Farm.",
    "notes": "There is a ping pong table in the basement, some games, a fire ring, and a small outdoor sauna for your use.  Guests are welcome to join in any programs that are happening on the farm during your stay - wild food walks, garden talks, cooking classes, yoga, bird walks.  Once you book, you can go to our website and explore.  If you have a group of 8 or more and staff are available, we can craft an experience for you.",

    "interaction": "We are available when needed.",
    "house_rules": "If you'd like to have a party, we have a party space on the farm. If it is available, JoAnn will work with you on details. No smoking inside the house.  If you smoke outside of the house you must pick up the butts and throw them in the trash.  We are an organic farm practicing environmental stewardship. We have tasty filtered well water so we prefer that folks do not bring plastic water bottles to the house.  Noise levels must be low after 10:00 p.m. on weekends and 9:00 p.m. on weekdays.  Basically, we ask that people respect the land, the house and its contents, and the neighbors.",

There was more than a few times where we stepped outside and said “wow it’s so quiet out here and peaceful” it was shocking to find a place that seemed so off the grid, yet close to many attractions, restaurants, etc. This was our first time trying out Airbnb and we are definitely hooked now thanks to Tara and Shawn! Great place to stay and would definitely stay again! Thank you both!",

    "summary": "This cozy cottage has a primitive glamping feel with no running water and minimal comforts. It’s not for everyone so read the description closely to make sure it fits your needs. With the comforts of ac, heat and electricity contrasted with the simple living of no running water, a camp stove for cooking, a hand pump camp shower, a composting toilet and no tv or internet makes this the perfect place to relax and unwind. \nWe are two miles from Harpers Ferry and near the trail to Maryland Heights.",
    "space": "The cottage is small, cozy and all yours to use during your stay. We have two other rentals on the property and each feels like it’s own private retreat.\nThere is no tv, internet, or running water to the cottage. There is a primitive camp shower, a camp stove, and a composting toilet.",
    "access": "Guests have access to the entire cottage. Some of the outdoor space is shared with other guests.",
    "neighborhood": "UPDATE: Starting March 20th there is a road closure on Sandy Hook Road with a scenic detour. Plan on an extra 15 minutes to get here unless you’re coming in from the west (Hagerstown, Shepherdstown). On the upside it means there are no cars on the portion of the road between us and the C&O canal, making hiking to Harpers Ferry or biking to the C&O canal more enjoyable. This road is expected to be closed until Sept/Oct 2023\n\nWe are two miles from Harpers Ferry by way of the footbridge over the river. We are between mile post 61 and 62 on the c&o canal. Lots of hiking and biking opportunities. The closest town is Brunswick, MD about 15 minutes by car where you can shop for groceries, grab a bite to eat, or use the internet at the local library.",
    "transit": "You will need a car or bike to get around unless you love walking. Harpers Ferry train station is two miles away. Grocery stores and eateries are also two to seven miles away.",

We played our music and had a few drinks, it was the highlight of our trip. \n\n10/10 I would recommend and return. This being our first trip to an Airbnb, our next trip will have tough time living up to the standard set by this property and host.",

The back of the house has a lovely porch facing the pasture with beautiful and docile horses. The farm is located in a green and calm area, and even though it can be  busy with horseback riding lessons and equestrian competitions it did not interfere with a peaceful stay. Also the property has a great heated pool surrounded a beautiful garden that was perfect for this extreme hot weekend.\nI am happy that I found a place to relax just 1 1/2 hours from Maryland with a perfect host. \nAlso, on the same road you can find a vineyard and brewery next to each other, and good restaurants just 10 minutes away.",

There is lots of activity to observe on an active horse farm and training facility. The best part was relaxing on the porch,  watching the horses, birds and wildlife come and go against a backdrop of rolling green hills and blue skies. Definitely check ou the Country Store, they made grab and go sandwiches for a picnic!",

The kitchen and family room areas provided enough space for us to unwind and relax, and the bedrooms were spacious with comfortable beds and pillows.  The rural setting was peaceful, with beautiful views of the surrounding areas.\n\nWe did encounter one small issue while there, but the owners were VERY responsive and had our problem solved within 15 minutes.  We were very impressed but their quick reply to our messages (via the Airbnb app), and arrival on site to resolve the problem.  One of the best Airbnb experiences we've had in this regard!\n\nOverall, an excellent stay at this home.  Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a rural setting and comfortable home.",

  "description": {
    "summary": "This beautiful house is the culmination of eight friends’ vision for a more ecological, communal and artistic future. For three years, we worked with a leading firm in sustainable architecture to design and build this house. Set at the apex of a 33-acre Grassfed cattle farm, this 4 bedroom, 3 loft, 2.5 bath dwelling is ideal for family get-togethers and intimate reunions with old friends. Many Blue Ridge Mountain sunsets have been celebrated from the balcony.",
    "space": "As the realization of a life project, we take great pride in this house and the surrounding lands, and will provide guides to the grounds, local produce from the farm (when available) and recommendations for activities unavailable to the casual traveler. Please check the Guidebook section of our Airbnb page for some initial suggestions of activities in the area.\n\nHouse specifics: \n \n- 5 queen beds placed across 4 independent bedrooms (one en suite) and 3 lofts. \n\n- 1 full bathroom, 1 bathroom with a hybrid “ship-shower”, and 1 half bathroom in the silo, as well as an outdoor shower.\n\n- The light-filled, state-of-the-art, open kitchen features a picture window overlooking the rolling Virginia hills, a gas stove, and modern appliances (refrigerator, microwave, etc.). The space just calls out to passionate cooks. In line with our focus on a small building footprint, the refrigerator and stove are modest.  We are happy to recommend the best farms in the area for local produce and a list of more traditional grocers in the area.\n\n- Heating and cooling is conducted in individual units in each room, the most efficient available today. Each bedroom can be modified according to individual guest's comfort, but please keep all units on the same general mode (heat, A/C, or fan, etc). \n\n- In the \"Great Room\" upstairs, there is a functioning fireplace, ideal for cold nights.  \n\n- The house does have WIFI, though it can be inconsistent. If you are planning to need streaming video or a solid connection to work remotely please let us know in advance and we can double check the internet status.  There is usually solid 4G/5G coverage, especially for Verizon and AT&T customers.  \n\n- There is a record player and CD player (with Aux connection) for music.\n\n- Pets are allowed, just give us a heads up if you would like to bring one as there are ticks and poison ivy in the pasture areas. We keep a section of the main pasture mowed as a yard, which should have less risk of ivy or ticks, and is a great spot for yard games (we have croquet and frisbees in the silo).\n\nPlease note, THIS IS A WORKING FARM, THERE MAY BE SOME BUGS AND DIRT. (And cell phones work fine but we do not have WiFi.) We clean the house after each guest visit and mow the yard every 2-3 weeks, but our primary goal is not to replicate a hotel experience. Our focus has been on designing a functional, creative, and inspiring space where we can also host artist residencies and sustainable agriculture operations.",
    "access": "Guests are able to access the entire home, though we may keep one room locked with personal belongings from time to time.",
    "notes": "Please note that a Virginia sales/occupancy tax of 5.3% will be added to the price.",
    "neighborhood": "The farmhouse is part of a larger 33 acre farm purchased by the owners in 2013.  The farm includes a cabin with a pre-civil war leather shop that has been converted to an artist's studio. Be ready to explore the land considered some of the most beautiful in Virginia!  Adjacent to the famous Rapidan River and at the foot of historic Clark's Mountain, there are many fun outdoor activities to be found. Local wildlife includes deer, foxes, groundhogs, coyotes, and a once-spotted black bear. It's a great bird habitat for amateur ornithologists (with bald eagle, red-tail hawk, spotted owl, and blue heron sightings amongst others!). 13 acres of the property are in a conservation program to support native habitat and restore the Rapidan river (part of the Chesapeake Bay watershed). \n\nGetting there and around:\n- The farm is 80 miles / 90 minute drive from DC and it's suburbs, 45 minutes from Charlottesville.  It’s 10 minutes from Orange and its quaint old town, replete with grocery stores, antique shops and local dining options.\n\n- It's a perfect base to explore Virginia's unique historical heritage: Montpelier (20 minutes away), Monticello and UVA (45 minutes away), or central Virginia's best winemaker: Barboursville Vineyards (25 minutes away). There is also plenty opportunities to hike, bike and get moving outdoors. \n\n- Closest towns are Orange (10 min drive) and Culpeper (25 min drive) for grocery shopping and restaurants.",
    "transit": "The closest public transit option is the Culpeper Amtrak. Culpeper also has rental cars and the odd taxi, but your best bet is bringing your own vehicle. The gravel driveway can get a bit slick in snow or rain, so please exercise caution as needed.",
    "interaction": "You will have the whole house to yourselves. Our two farmers live on the other side of the property and may be able to give you a tour of their agricultural operations if interested.

Sharon was very responsive. Any time I had a question she replied immediately. The yard was spacious and the grounds look just like the pictures. There’s a nice front porch and back deck to sit on and enjoy the quiet. We had a great time. This house is close to all the attractions. Super easy to get everywhere.

My husband sat outside every morning, drank coffee and did a little work (on his computer) before we headed to Hershey Park. The house and decor is magazine worthy. We visited Cindi’s store and purchased things to add to our home. Cindi was very responsive to all messages and even gave us a great recommendation for Horse Back Riding.  We would visit again!",

We only allow 1 Unit to be booked at any given time. Our current protocol for when 1 of the 2 Units are booked is to take the 2nd Unit offline.  If two units were to be booked consecutively, we will make adjustments accordingly in order to maintain the recommended social distancing guidelines.\n\nAdditionally...\n*One Reservation per Rental Unit at a time.\n*Rental Charge for Mom's Retreat & the Beach House Bungalow is by the Guest. Max 2 Guests.  \n*Rental Charge for Peak View is by the Unit. Additional charges apply for 3rd Guest. Max 3 Guests.\n*Rental Charge for Lake View is by the Unit. Max 2 Guests.\n*Shared Bath is detached & a short walk from all Units.\nMom's Retreat-50 paces/30 sec walk.\nPeak View-75 paces/30 sec walk.\nBeach House Bungalow-150 paces/1 1/2 min walk.\nLake View Retreat-300 paces/3 min walk.\n*Perfect place for Hikers, Bikers, or Skiiers.  \n*If unsteady on your feet please note this property has uneven terrain, graveled walkways & stepping stone paths.\n*No Smoking or Vaping.

Especially, with our Furbabies, Sophia Rose & Ashton Duval, our 4 year old brother & sister Yorkies Babies, & our good ole' boy, Zeke, our 12 year old Beagle!\n\nChris & I have an appreciation for beautiful places, like Key West & Palm Springs. Virginia is not exactly in a tropical locale, but we have done our best to bring the best of these two beautiful places here to Virginia, as you can see from our photos! \n\nWe believe very highly in the official Key West Motto, \"One Human Family\"! So much so, that it is our adoptive Motto on life too! \"All People Are Created Equal Members Of One Human Family\". What's not to like about that?!  :)\n\nWe hope you will plan to stay with us for a spell, while you take in all of the beauty that is the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia! From Massanutten's Four Seasons Resort, to the gorgeous Blue Ridge Parkway/Skyline Drive! There is much for you to enjoy! You will also want to check-out places like The Luray Caverns, many local Wineries & Homes of Former Presidents, and all else in between! There is just so much to see, eat & do within minutes to an hour from our location!\n\nTest this theory out, by checking us out!

    "space": "THE SPACE:\n\nLake View Retreat is currently blocked out, but it can be made available upon request. Just ask...\n\nPoints to Consider Before Booking with us:\n\nFirst & Foremost, please be aware that We, your Hosts, are both fully vaccinated. In addition, we follow Airbnb's enhanced cleaning protocol, which was developed with expert guidance. Here are a few highlights:\n\nWe sanitize high-touch surfaces, down to the doorknob\nWe use cleaners and disinfectants approved by global health agencies, and we wear protective gear to help prevent cross-contamination\nwe clean each room using extensive cleaning checklists\nwe provide extra cleaning supplies, so you can clean as you stay\nWe comply with local laws, including any additional safety or cleaning guidelines\n\nIn addition, we also leave the Unit empty for a minimum of 3 days between bookings to allow ample time for the unit to be cleaned and sanitized between bookings.  \n\nWe do have 4 Units listed on this site.  2 of these 4 Units are offline at this time to help maintain social distancing.  We only allow 1 Unit to be booked at any given time. Our current protocol for when 1 of the 2 Units are booked is to take the 2nd Unit offline.  If two units were to be booked consecutively, we will make adjustments accordingly in order to maintain the recommended social distancing guidelines.\n\nOn another important note, we do understand, and we are familiar with, the AirBnB Guidelines, as they relate to Emotional Support Animals (ESA).\n\nUnfortunately, with Guests being in a shared space, an ESA Animal would create a health and safety hazard, as we have 4 dogs on site that are not at all friendly with other animals. Although our pets are very much people friendly, they are super protective of their space when it comes to other animals. In addition, our Units are very small and not set up to handle animals, be they categorized as pets, or as (ESA) Emotional Support Animals.\n\nLastly, during the winter season when there is snow/ice on the roads, a 4x4, or an elevated AWD or FWD vehicle, such as a Subaru Outback or similar style vehicle, is strongly recommended to get in and out of our location. Feel free to ask about the road conditions before booking.\n\nWith that shared, we are just beginning to get into the Skiing Season, & Hiking Season is around the corner!  It's a great time to come stay a spell and check out local scenery, such as Massanutten Resort; the Appalachian Trail/ Blue Ridge Parkway; local wineries; area festivals, and so on. Please see our Guidebook for places to visit while in the area. Make some weekend getaway plans today, won't you?\n\nBy completing your booking, you agree to abide by and follow the House Rules, and are confirming you have  read the *EXPANDED SPECIAL NOTICES* below:\n\n*One (1) Reservation per Cottage (2 Guests).\n     -Maximum Guest Count for Peak View Cottage is (2) Adults (One (1)Double/Full Sized Bed).\n     -Adjust the number of Guests in the drop down menu. (Knowing the number of Adult Guests for your Reservation allows us to plan accordingly for your stay.)\n\n*Minimum 2-Night Stay is Required.\n\n*Strict Cancellation Policy:\n     -Full refund for cancellations made within 48 hours of booking, if the check-in date is at least 14 days away. 50% refund for cancellations made at least 7 days before check-in. No refunds for cancellations made within 7 days of check-in.\n\n*Shared Bath is detached & approximately 135 paces/1 minute short walk from Lake View Retreat. This space is kept clean & sterilized, especially with the Coronavirus, & because it is cold & flu season in general.\n\n*Our Property has uneven terrain & graveled walkways (Slow and steady balanced walking is needed on ALL paths or step stones.  Those with balance concerns, or whom are unstable on their feet will seriously need to traverse outside locations with extreme care and caution.  Straying off of established walkways is highly discouraged.)\n\n*No Smoking/Vaping/Tobacco Products/Illegal Drugs (Inside or outside, or while within our property gates)  This includes NO use of Candles or Incense, or any other flame and/or smoke producing products that are to be used within this Cottage, or throughout the property.\n\n*No Photography throughout our Property w/out prior approval (verbal approval is fine, please just ask us FIRST!) As this is a Private Property, we wish to maintain our spaces for the enjoyment of all, so please keep all pictures that are taken for your personal use only.  We do not authorize pictures taken for commercial publication or Social Media, without our written consent.\n\n*No Pets (We DO have Dogs and Cats on-site, so please be aware - interactions will be minimal and kept to outside shared spaces only. Occasional barking may be experienced if we are offsite... Please contact us if the pets become an issue during your stay, and we will correct the situations immediately.)\n\n*No Weapons, Hunting or Fishing.\n\n*No Swimming or Boating.\n\n*No Unauthorized Parties (Unless you are visiting for a pre-arranged Birthday Gathering, or a Wedding, or any other pre-scheduled similar social event).\n\n*Keeping your safety and ours in mind, we have security cameras throughout the property monitoring exterior areas only.  This meets our insurance expectations, and ensures your's and our property is kept secure.\n\n*MONDAY-FRIDAY CHECK-INS ARE AFTER 6PM (Unless other arrangements have been agreed to). We are able to be more flexible on Saturday & Sunday check-ins. Just ask and we will try to accommodate your request, within reason.\n\n*Daily Rates for Peak View Cottage are as stated on the AirBnB Booking Page.\n\n*Only the detached bathroom & common areas (BBQ, Firepit, Picnic Spots) are shared spaces.\n\n*Our Property is not suitable for children under 12 due to water (Pond/Creek) throughout the property, and the need to walk slowly and carefully throughout our given graveled and landscaped walkways.  If children are included as your Guests, Adult(s) and/or Guardians MUST AGREE to accompany their Child Guests AT ALL TIMES while on the property!  Running & horseplay are prohibited. For example, if gravel is picked up and thrown about, resulting in property damage to structures or cars, (this becomes a serious issue with younger stayers), then their Guardians shall be held liable for the resulting damages incurred.\n\n*ONLY GUESTS have approved access onto our property. Your reservation grant's you usage of your reserved Cottage and access to the shared bathroom space.  Any additional day Guests will require our prior approval- and in some instances, if repeated or excessive stays are expected, additional fees will apply.\n\n*Keep Host Address Private! For Host Privacy & Security, as well as that of Future Guests, the sharing of Host's Physical Address with ANY outside party or entity is Strictly Prohibited.\n\nWe request Guests provide us with these three (3) notifications on the day of arrival to allow us, the Hosts, to plan for our day. \n\n*DAY OF ARRIVAL:\n     -1st notice is when departing your location for our location. \n     -2nd notice is when you are 30 minutes from arriving. \n     -3rd & last notice is when you are 5 minutes from arriving.\n\n*Upon receiving the last notice, we will ready ourselves to meet you in the parking lot. We'll show you your parking spot, give you a brief tour of the Cottage & shared detached bathroom, and highlight some House Rules. For additional information, please see the House Manual.\n\n*Lake View Retreat is one of four Cottages we have available.\n\n*The Cottages share a detached bathroom. This space is kept clean & sterilized, especially with the Coronavirus, & because it is cold & flu season in general. \n\n\n*Here are links to all four of them:\n     -https://airbnb.com/h/peak-view-cottage \n     -https://airbnb.com/h/lake-view-retreat \n     -https://airbnb.com/h/beach-house-bungalow\n     -https://airbnb.com/h/moms-retreat  \n\nThank You for your interest and your possible visit with us!",

We formerly had a business remodeling and renovating older houses, adding many homes to our portfolio over the years. \n\nWhat began as a dream for a lifestyle change for our family turned into reality when we bought 22 acres and a property that needed a lot of love, and moved from downtown to a country home. We then channeled our love of renovation into Airbnb’s, remodeling the two we currently have on and bordering our property, and loving to give our guests a unique and memorable experience. \n\nWe travel often as a family of 7 and try to make our own Airbnb’s as beautiful as they practical, as we like it to be for our own travel. Bon voyage!",

Clarita was super friendly and responsive and thought of every detail. Our son particularly loved Old Windmill Farm, a working Amish farm where they let you interact/ bottle fed the baby animals- pigs, bunnies, goats, chickens, calves and even saw a 1 week old colt.  The farm stay was nothing short of amazing, our second time here. Highly recommend.",

    "summary": "Welcome to the Inglewood Farm! \n\nInspired by Old European design, this gives  you a luxury stay in a sweet cottage. Tucked in a peaceful wooded corner  on our 20-acre 1700’s farmstead, you can visit the animals, see the rhythm of our family farm life, and enjoy being in nature. \n\nLocated 3 miles south of Lancaster, we are 15-20 minutes within major attractions including Sight & Sound Theatre, Amish Country, Strasburg, and Lititz.",
    "space": "The 480 square foot, 2-bedroom with a cozy cottage feel is darling and welcoming and you may not even want to leave the indoor space or the deck right off the kitchen. The space is styled and decorated with items from quality stores such as Crate & Barrel, West Elm, as well as uniquely sourced antiques. \n\nThe kitchen is fully stocked with anything you might need to cook a meal (bring your own food!) and we provide everything you want for a comfortable and special night getaway. We provide a Nepresso machine as well as a French press and Chemex to ensure all our coffee lovers will be satisfied. \n\nBedroom #1 is has a queen bed with luxury bedding, as well as a huge picture window overlooking the woods behind the cottage, creating a look into nature from your bed which is a most beautiful experience. The draperies do close fully for when you want your privacy. The closet holds comfortable bathrobes to enjoy during your stay. There is a luggage rack for your use as well. \n\nBedroom #2 is what we call our Wildflower room, and holds two twin beds with a cozy and airy feel. A luggage rack provides a space for your belongings. \n\nThe living room holds a cozy sofa as well as two arm chairs, and throw blankets for your use. The high speed internet allows you to access the TV in the living room with Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, or many more of your favorite online TV shows and movies. \n\nBut if you enjoy the outdoors, you are free to wander the acres of woods with our trails, sit by the creek, and enjoy the peaceful nature setting. There is a large deck with a table and chairs  for 4, and gas grill as well as a separate campfire spot with 4 Adirondack chairs, fire pit - the perfect place to make s’mores and hot chocolate. Basically it’s like glamping in style - a luxury small-space cottage with all your needs and wants but giving you the opportunity to be in nature as you wish. \n\nSelf-check in after 4pm.\n\nIt’s the perfect location for a getaway while still being close to almost anything you’d like to do in the city if you want to be out and about. We are within 15 minutes of wonderful nature preserves with great hiking trails, or you can enjoy the indoor space with access to Netflix and Amazon Prime video. You also have the option to work remotely with our high speed internet.\n\n** no more than four children, including children**\n\n** no pets are allowed, no exceptions. Failure to follow the no-pet policy will result in a $300/day penalty.\n\n** we are in the country and do our best to give a clean space (some guests have said it’s the cleanest space they’ve ever stayed in).  However, due to being in the country please realize there are some bugs and small insects that we don’t have control over, due to farms nearby",
    "notes": "There are various animals on the farm, and we hope they will only add delight to your stay. We have Angus beef cows, Pygmy goats, Southdown Babydoll sheep, alpacas, and in the warmer weather possibly other animals as well!",
    "neighborhood": "We are located 3 miles south of the charming Lancaster city, which has the oldest on-going market in the nation (definitely a place to visit on Tuesday, Friday, or Saturday during your stay). There are wonderful food options, some of the best coffee shops in the nation, and unique shopping experiences with Tanger Outlets 15 minuets away. \n\nWe are also within 15 minutes of some wonderful nature trails and preserves, if being in nature is something you are looking forward to. \n\nIf you’re coming for Amish country, we are 15 minutes from the main attractions you will want to visit. Strasburg is also a darling destination spot with antiques and an old fashioned ice cream shop, and we are 15 minutes from there.",
    "transit": "There is parking for your personal vehicle, and Uber and Lyft are available also.",
    "interaction": "We are available by text at all times for anything you might need, but give you the space to have a private getaway.",
    "house_rules": "You are not expected to clean the cottage space, but we do ask that you wash up the dishes you used during your stay and put the dirty sheets (sheets only; no comforters please) into the washer before you leave. Thank you!",

We now have a 6 bedroom home with a heated in door pool, a cottage, a cabin, a farmhouse that sleeps 14 and our newest house that opened May 26 2017!  \r\n  I grew up in South Carolina on Hilton Head Island.  I left at 17 and traveled extensively finally to spend a lot of time in South Beach and New York City.  Being in the fashion industry for over 20 years I have stayed at amazing hotels and have been fortunate enough to meet and work with designers from all over the word.  I have incorporated both a passion for real estate and hospitality to share with travelers from all over with our cabins.  They might be rustic rentals in the country but they are loaded with any and every luxury one could want.  I love interacting with all our guests and help any way I can to make their stay 100% enjoyable.  \r\n\r\nMy family and I live on a retired apple orchard ten miles out of Gettysburg.  I have a love for healthy food and a healthy lifestyle.  My work and family keep me extremely busy along with a ton of pets indoor and outdoor.  We love to make the use of all 30 acres.  \r\n\r\nHopefully we will start using airbnb places in our upcoming travel!",

Close enough to Gettysburg to enjoy restaurants and attractions, but far enough away to relax and unwind after a day of sightseeing. The camper is beautifully renovated with all the comforts of home. Not to mention, immaculately clean. Every detail was well thought out - including the provided robes and slippers which I wish I had found sooner. We didn't do much cooking but the kitchen had all that you would need to cook for two. Wish our stay had been longer and that the weather was a little better so we could have enjoyed the outdoor area more. Despite the rain, we still enjoyed the hot tub.\n\nIf we are ever back in the Gettysburg area, we will be sure to stay again.",

The cottage windows all look out into lovely pollinator gardens, and the puppies are delightful co-hosts. We also had a very clear view of the peak of the Perseid meteor shower; the farm is perfectly remote (but only 20 mins from downtown cville) for stargazing. Hope to stay again soon!",

It’s far enough away from the city to enjoy the land and beautiful rolling hills but close enough to get to everything fun. I highly recommend this and would certainly book this again in the future.",

You can bring out your dinner and sit by the fire and chat the night away under the starry sky. You can stroll down the road to where Fosters Branch starts for a morning meditation. You can sit on the day bed and watch a movie. You can watch the sunset or sunrise and let the sound of the birds & crickets heal your mind & body. \nWe also loved how downtown is only 15-20mins away (oh so many cute shops there were!). \n\nAll that to say, I cannot recommend this place enough and planning to sneak away with my husband next time ;) Cynthia was very responsive, kind and reliable & we are grateful for this time of retreat.",

  "description": {
    "summary": "Tranquil Cottage is an adorable home with breathtaking sunset and Blue Ridge mountain views unlike anywhere in the Charlottesville area. We are 5 miles from downtown and minutes to some of the best vineyards and restaurants in the Piedmont. Enjoy comfortable beds, well equipped kitchen, a fire pit and Adirondack chairs. Walk our country roads, feed the horses,  enjoy the views of the mountains. We welcome all people, base price is for 2 people  so sorry no pets or children under 12 for safety.",
    "space": "Tranquil Estate is a very special place where the big sky meets the Blue Ridge mountains. We moved here because Charlottesville is small city that has farm to table values and a countryside which makes you feel like you’re on vacation. \nThe decor is industrial farmhouse and all of the amenities are new; including the beds! We will leave a few necessities in the kitchen like coffee, tea, salt seasonings and olive oil. There is a Keurig and a drip coffee maker with coffee pods. There is a new cuisinart induction cooktop and a new cuisinart fryer, toaster, and baking oven. There are two mini-splits which are set at 70 in the summer and winter unless you request it changed which is not a problem. There is a window AC unit you can control along with ceiling fans and stationary fans. Let us know if you are too warm or cold so we can make you comfortable!\nWe have a huge 10+ acre field with horses and cows over the fence. It is a very peaceful property. There is a large table to work on - perhaps write that novel sitting in the back of your head. The property also is the perfect place to paint en plein air. Bring wood, paper and marshmallows for the fire pit!\nSorry, pets are not allowed. Base price covers two people.",
    "access": "You’ll have the cottage to yourself and there are tall evergreens separating the view between houses so it is private. Since it is a small farm you may see me out and about as I take care of the property and animals. We are mindful that you are here to rest and relax and always do our best to accommodate guests needs. The dogs are in and out all day but if you prefer not to see them just say so and we will do our best to keep them inside. Their names are Foster the Basset Hound, and Pippa our young Corgi",
    "notes": "Horses: Merlin the Percheron/Thoroughbred has been my horse for more than 15 years. Ruby the paint horse is 7 years old. Both are sweethearts and very beautiful unless it is muddy...ugh. Sometimes they are in a paddock up close to the cottage which is really fun for our guests. They are kept in an electric fence but love a visit. They enjoy real food like apples and carrots and hold your hand FLAT when giving them these treats.\nFire Pit Stuff:  Bring wood and paper for your fire pit and the MARSHMALLOWS!!! If you forget something just ask- we probably have it!\n\nFirst time Airbnb users need to know that being a part of the Airbnb family is super unique. We have traveled the world this way. We welcome new people when we see them enjoying our property. When we travel,  our hosts are those who share their restaurants and “must see and do” information not found on line.Meeting new people is what Airbnb is all about- not just staying at a place- you’re staying in a part of a home. We think that’s so cool. \nWe look forward to hosting you at our beautiful estate.\nCynthia and Chuck",
    "neighborhood": "The cottage is in an area of old barns, rolling hills, dirt roads, newborn calves, and friendly people who wave when they go by. It's 5 miles to Downtown Charlottesville for all kinds of cultural activities, the UVA campus, and wonderful restaurants. Barboursville, Merry Hill, Horton, Castle Hill Cidery, Pipen Hill, Glass House Vineyards make us a great spot to enjoy a good glass a vino amd cider. \nThe Shenandoah Mountains are outside your window and 40 minutes to a trail head- not to mention kayaking the Rivanna River down the road.",
    "transit": "We do have Lyft and Uber service. Let us know when they’re coming or better yet meet them at the gate- they go so fast and don’t know about the animals. Thank you!",
    "interaction": "We are available if you need us. Otherwise enjoy your privacy.",
    "house_rules": "- Have Fun!\n-But absolutely no smoking or vaping at all...there will be a fine...sorry to be a buzz kill...\n\n- Small gatherings are fine,  just run it by me first-especially for graduation and parents weekend. We understand wanting to gather together with your family.\n- Overall, please leave the cottage as you’ve found it. \n- We request for cleanliness purposes please remove your shoes. Walking through the grass etc brings in all kinds of farmyard animal dirt. \nThank you!",

The barn is surrounded by our horse pastures and neighboring fields.  Self check in with the key lockbox.  This loft is separate from the main house where we live.  Private parking and entrance for our guests directly outside of barn loft (this is separate from the main house driveway).",
    "space": "One bedroom with queen bed (semi-private with a half wall).  Spiral staircase leads up to a loft with two twin beds, easily adapted to queen if desired.  Large open living space with full kitchen.  One full bath.  Laundry closet with washer/dryer.",
    "access": "The entire loft is yours.  The field across the road from us is our neighbor's property, as well as any land outside of the  black fence. Our property is surrounded by the black fence.",
    "neighborhood": "Our neighborhood is a private road with several large properties on it, great for walks or runs.\nJust 3 miles down the road is a large park, Darden Towe park, that offers extensive walking/biking trails.  These trails run along the Rivanna River and connect to many trails throughout the city of Charlottesville.  There are several river access points for kayaks, canoes, and paddleboards.  Just past the park is convenient shopping for groceries, coffee shops and several restaurants.  The loft is 4.3 miles to Charlottesville Downtown mall and 5.6 miles to the University of Virginia grounds.  There are also several vineyards within a 10 mile radius.",
    "interaction": "We live in the main house on the property.  We are available if needed for any questions, etc.  Otherwise, we want to provide a peaceful, private stay for our guests.  The lower level of the barn is used by us, but has a completely separate entrance. We have a few hens and one gray cat (stays outside).  In the summer we keep our horses in our adjoining fields.",

    "space": "The Last Cast\n\nWelcome to your home away from home in the beautiful countryside of Virginia along Lake Anna. This spacious and modern cabin has more than enough room for your group or large family to vacation comfortably. The deck faces west so that the gorgeous sunsets can be enjoyed at your leisure, or even in the hot tub. Spend your days on the white sand beach sunbathing, or on the lake boating, kayaking, paddleboarding, fishing, and every other waterfront sport you can think of. Tour the town and find the Chancellorsville Battlefield and Visitor Center, wineries, mini-golf, and Lake Anna State Park.\r\n\r\nInside you'll find a bright interior simply filled with natural light, the completely wooden interior and stone fireplace a stunning sight to behold. The open floor plan promotes togetherness, so no conversation will be missed here. Gather around the two-story fireplace to have a movie night on the large TV, or just share stories and make memories. Prepare grand meals and lake picnic snacks in the spacious kitchen, equipped with stainless steel appliances. This gorgeous cabin boasts six beds, each comfortable and roomy bedroom with space for personal effects. The main bedroom has a lovely en suite bathroom with a double-sink vanity, a soaking tub, and a luxurious walk-in shower. Make memories in the game room where you'll find dozens of board games and puzzles, a foosball table, and a shuffleboard table. At the end of the day, roast marshmallows and tell ghost stories at the firepit and watch the stars come out to dot the sky.\r\n\r\n<b>THINGS TO KNOW</b>\r\nFor little guests, a crib and Pack N Play are provided.\r\nThis property is managed by Vacasa Virginia LLC.\n2 dog(s)  are welcome in this home.

In case of any conflict between the Vacasa Terms and the Airbnb Terms of Service (“Airbnb Terms”) that apply to your reservation, the Airbnb Terms will control.\n\nThese Vacasa Terms are between: (1) Vacasa (“Vacasa,” “we,” or “us”), acting for itself and for the owner of the Property (“Owner”), and (2) the person who is the responsible renter of the Property (collectively “Renter” or “you”). You acknowledge that you have read and understand, and agree to be bound by, all terms, conditions, and policies in these Vacasa Terms.\n\nCertain jurisdictions, resorts, and specific homes require renters to agree to additional terms and conditions (“Unit-Specific Terms”). If any provision of the Unit-Specific Terms differs from the general provisions of the Vacasa Terms, the provision of the Unit-Specific Terms will control.\n\nVacasa operates using different legal entities in different geographical regions. As used in these Vacasa Terms, the term “Vacasa” means the entity specified in the Unit-Specific Terms, if any. If no entity is specified in the Unit-Specific Terms, then:\n·   If the Property is located in the United States or Mexico, Vacasa means Vacasa LLC.\n·   If Property is located in Europe (meaning one of the countries of the European Union or Switzerland), Vacasa means Vacasa Europe AG.\n·   If the Property is located in Canada, Vacasa means Vacasa Canada ULC.\n·   If the Property is located in South Africa, Vacasa means Vacasa South Africa (PTY) Ltd.\n·   If the Property is located in one of the following countries in Latin America or the Caribbean, then Vacasa means:\n            o   In Belize: Vacasa Belize Ltd.\n            o   In Chile: Vacation Rental SpA\n            o   In Colombia: Vacasa Colombia S.A.S.\n            o   In Costa Rica: Vacasa del Pacífico Central de Costa Rica Ltda\n            o   In the Dominican Republic: Vacasa, S.A.S.\n            o   In Honduras: Vacasa Honduras S.

You agree that your use of the Property is on a temporary and transient basis only; that you may not use the Property as a permanent residence; and that your permanent residence is and will remain elsewhere than at the Property.\n\nF. Animals.  We accept assistance animals in line with Airbnb's Nondiscrimination Policy. No other animals or pets of any kind are permitted at the Property except as specifically authorized in your reservation. You also agree that we cannot and do not guarantee that no animals have been in the Property prior to your use or that the Property is free of animal or pet allergens, even if the Property listing states that pets are prohibited or includes a similar description.\n\nG. Events; Commercial Photography; Structures; Charcoal Grills. Parties and other events are prohibited at the Property. Commercial photography and filming are also prohibited at the Property without our express written permission. (If approved, applicable occupancy limits and other rules under Airbnb's Party and Events Policy will apply, and additional conditions and fees may apply.) No tents or other structures may be erected on the property. The use of charcoal grills is prohibited.\n\nH. Criminal Activity Prohibited. Use of the Property for any criminal activity is prohibited and may result in fines, prosecution, and/or your immediate removal from the Property. This prohibition extends to use of the Property’s internet service, if any, for criminal activity, including but not limited to unlawful downloads of copyrighted material, including movies, music, software, or other material. We may cooperate with any investigation of alleged criminal activity that occurred at the Property during your stay.\n\nI. Consequences of Breach; Charges for Damage. Any failure by you or any other Occupants to comply with any of the terms, conditions, or policies above is a breach of these Vacasa Terms and may result in a forfeiture of your rights to rent the Property, up to and including immediate removal from the Property without refund and with or without the assistance of law enforcement. Vacasa may terminate your occupancy of the Property for breach, and if you are notified of such termination you agree to leave the Property immediately. In addition, subject to Airbnb’s damage claim policies, you are responsible for (1) any damage or loss that occurs at the Property during your stay; (2) a charge of up to $1,000 for violations of the pet policy, including for bringing more pets or different types of pets than specifically authorized; (3) an additional cleaning fee of up to $500 (or the actual cost of cleaning services, if greater) for violations of any of the guest policies above (other than the pet policy) or for excessive cleaning required by the acts or omissions of any Occupant during your stay; and (4) any fines issued by police, other government officials or agencies, utility providers, and/or homeowner associations for violation of any law, ordinance, or rule during your stay, and any damages (which may exceed the amount of fines) that result from the violation. If any unauthorized download of copyrighted material via the Property’s Internet service occurs during the period of your stay, you agree that we may obtain and share your contact information with the internet service provider or any other party we believe, for any reason, has enforcement rights.\n\nJ. Early Check-In/Late Check-Out.  Early check-in or late check-out may be available; additional charges may apply. If you do not vacate by check-out time (or late check-out time as agreed by Vacasa), you authorize us to charge a late departure fee of up to one night’s rental and we may remove all Occupants and their personal property from the Property.\n\nK. Maintenance or Housekeeping Issues; Property Conditions. The Property is provided as is, and we are not responsible for the inoperability or unavailability of any amenities. You agree to contact Vacasa, using the contact information provided in your confirmation email, as soon as you notice any maintenance or housekeeping problem, or any potentially hazardous condition, at the Property, or if any incident occurs at the Property that is related to such a problem or condition. You further agree to give Vacasa a reasonable amount of time to respond to your report and to cooperate with Vacasa’s efforts to address the concern or provide a remedy. We will take reasonable and appropriate steps to remedy any reported problem as soon as practicable. We may enter the Property at your invitation to remedy any problem you report, at reasonable times and with reasonable notice to inspect, maintain, or repair the Property, and to address any situation that we reasonably deem an emergency that threatens persons or property. You acknowledge that if the Property has access to amenities that are shared with other properties, such as a shared pool, hot tub, parking lot, or fitness center, that the availability and condition of those amenities is outside Vacasa’s control.\n\nL. Choice of Law; Jurisdiction and Venue; Dispute Resolution.\n\nL.1. Choice of Law. Unless otherwise specified in any Unit-Specific Terms or if a different choice of law is required by the law of the jurisdiction in which the Property is located: If the Property is outside Europe, these Vacasa Terms shall be governed by laws of the State of Oregon, U.S.A, without regard to its conflict-of-law provisions. If the Property is in Europe, these Vacasa Terms shall be governed by the laws of Switzerland, without regard to its conflict-of-law provisions.\n\nL.2. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement: United States. If (a) your claim against Vacasa relates in any way to a reservation for or stay at a Property located in the United States, or (b) you bring any other claim against Vacasa in the United States (to the extent permitted by these Vacasa Terms or the Airbnb Terms) (any such dispute, claim, or controversy under either (a) or (b) a “US Claim”), then you agree to resolve the US Claim as follows:\n\na. Agreement to Arbitrate. You and Vacasa mutually agree that any US Claim will be settled by binding arbitration rather than in court, such arbitration to be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules, or such other AAA arbitration rules that the AAA decides to be applicable to a specific dispute, that are in effect as of the time of service of an arbitration demand. Payment of filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. To begin an arbitration, a party must send a letter to the other party requesting arbitration and describing the claim. If Vacasa requests arbitration, it will send the letter to your most recent email or physical address in Vacasa’s records. If you request arbitration, you must send the letter to Vacasa’s registered agent in the state in which the Property you reserved or stayed at is located, or if the dispute does not involve a reservation for or stay at a specific property, to Vacasa’s registered agent in the state of Oregon.\n\nb. Place of Arbitration. The arbitration shall take place in the county in which the Property is located, or in Portland, Oregon, if the dispute does not involve a reservation for or stay at a specific property, or in such other location as you and Vacasa may mutually agree.\n\nc. Exceptions to Arbitration Requirement. As the only exceptions to the agreement to submit all US Claims to binding arbitration as provided herein, Vacasa and Renter both retain the right to pursue: (1) in small claims court in the county in which the Property is located (or if the dispute does not involve a reservation for a specific property, the small claims court for Multnomah County, Oregon), any claim that is within that court’s jurisdiction, and the parties consent to the personal jurisdiction and venue of such court; and (2) a suit in any court with jurisdiction to enjoin (whether by temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunctive relief) infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.\n\nL.3. Dispute Resolution: Outside the United States.\nEurope: If you are a resident of Europe and your claim relates in any way to a reservation for or stay at a Property located in Europe, you and Vacasa consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts in Zurich or Zug, Switzerland. If applicable law prohibits exclusive jurisdiction over your claim in Switzerland, then you and Vacasa agree to the non-exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts in Zurich or Zug, Switzerland, or your jurisdiction of residence.\nOutside Europe: If your claim relates in any way to a reservation for or stay at a Property located outside of Europe or the United States, you and Vacasa agree to bring any action in the courts of the country in which the Property is located, or in such other location and forum as you and Vacasa may mutually agree.\n\nL.4. Class Action and Jury Trial Waiver. You and Vacasa agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, you and Vacasa waive any right to a jury trial.\n\nM. Limitation of Liability. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO CASE SHALL THE OWNER OF THE PROPERTY OR VACASA, NOR THEIR AFFILIATES, NOR THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, OR OWNERS, BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY DAMAGES FOR PERSONAL OR BODILY INJURY, EMOTIONAL DISTRESS, OR DAMAGE TO PROPERTY, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR STAY AT THE PROPERTY. THIS LIMITATION APPLIES TO ALL CLAIMS FOR DAMAGES WHETHER BASED ON A THEORY OF WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING ORDINARY NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF VACASA HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE AND EVEN IF THE  LIMITED REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.\n\nN. Indemnity. You agree to hold harmless and indemnify Vacasa and Owner, and their respective affiliates, for and from all claims for property damage, personal injury, or monetary loss resulting from your actions or omissions, and the actions or omissions of other Occupants, during or relating to your stay.\n\nO. Substitution of Property. On rare occasions, due to ownership changes, properties being removed from rental use, or a need for extensive repairs or maintenance, the Property may not be available for rental on the dates of your reservation and Vacasa may have to cancel your booking. In this unlikely event, rebooking shall be subject to the Airbnb Terms for booking modifications.\n\nP. Assignment. Vacasa may assign these Terms or any of its rights, or delegate any of its duties under these Terms, at any time without your consent.",

Managing a small country Inn and restaurant for 12 of those years has given us ample experience to create and manage our unique Yurt as well as our other lodgings. My family and I are in process of creating a self supporting and sustainable farm homestead and lodgings and we offer welcome to one and all. In addition to our enterprises we are grateful stewards of nearly 60 acres of spectacular mountain land, most of which is as undisturbed as possible with an easily accessible nature trail winding throughout  the property. As a working farm we also have a multitude of gentle critters and an abundance of home grown foods.\r\n    Whitt grew up in Hawaii and knows well about relaxing and enjoying life and all it has to offer, and believe we have created a place where everyone can share in the same.\r\n\r\n   Martha grew up in Bethesda, a suburb just outside of DC and spent every possible moment at Cair Paravel. Now retired from teaching and educational administration I spend my days at the farm or volunteering the the Virginia Master Naturalists.\r\n\r\nOther folks you may see on the farm are Madi, Grant, Mark and Ruth. Madi and Grant (photo with goats) work with the animals and gardens. Mark is the master of the trails and you may see Ruth running.\r\n\r\nJoin us!",

It may very well have been bad timing but farm tours were not available, the farm food to order that we were looking forward to was not on the site. There’s a huge tub in the unit, but there was a water shortage so there were instructions not to fill up. \n\nSome of these were understandable, but overall we drastically changed our plans to spend time off property. We were looking forward to at least doing a self guided farm tour, but were told on site that our leashed dogs would cause an issue with livestock guard dogs. No mention of this in the listing. We communicated that we were going to do a farm tour and they knew we had dogs, but didn’t say a thing until we pulled up to walk around. \n\nThere are also a lot of rules that are restrictive for a person on vacation!  It felt more incumbent upon me to be a good guest than for them to be good hosts",

There is also NO running near or around the pool or spa areas. \n\nSPA: Please avoid immersion in the spa for prolonged periods of time. According to APSP “No young child should be allowed in a hot tub until they can stand on the bottom and have their head remain completely out of the water. Children who are big enough to be in a hot tub should not use it for more than five minutes at a time, especially at the maximum temperature of 104 degrees.” DO NOT STAND ON THE HOT TUB COVERS.  Hot tub covers are for insulation purposes and are not designed to support a person or persons.  They will break and you may be charged for replacement. Remember when not using the hot tub, leave cover on so hot tub will stay warm. If you adjust the temperature of the spa/hot tub return it to 102 degrees when you leave.\n\nALCOHOL USE IN POOL AND SPA: Consuming alcoholic beverages and/or drugs and use of the pool or spa can be dangerous and cause serious health risks.

Hiking at Moormans River was definitely a highlight!\n\nFinally, I would be remiss not to mention the delicious breakfast. Underneath her humble and unassuming airs, Chi is a master chef.

It is a very small hamlet entirely rural in character. \n\nThe village was originally referred to as Nicksville after a free slave blacksmith named Nick, who opened a blacksmith's shop there in the early 19th century. When a post office was established in 1847, it was given the name of Free Union to avoid confusion with Nixville, another post office in the county. The name was taken from that of the Free Union Church, which had been built in 1837 and is still operating as the Free Union Baptist Church. The church was \"free\" in that all races were welcome to worship there, and it was a \"union\" of four denominations of Christianity, none of which could have afforded a church of their own at that time.",

We were a group of 14 people, including 6 kids, plenty of space for everyone, huge dining table for all of us to eat together without being crowded. Kitchen is well stocked. Easy check in and check out, house is very clean, everything went smoothly. Beautiful house and beautiful views to wake up to in the morning, including cows and horses. Quite area, the only thing you hear are birds chirpint and the occasional horse and buggy. Really fell in love with this location and house. There is also plenty of fun attractions for kids and the whole family within a 20 minute drive: including strasburg train ride, Amish horse and buggy ride/tours, free petting zoos, cherry crest adventure park. 40 minutes away there is the turkey hill experience which was really cool too, you make your own ice cream. But really you can have a great time just relaxing on the property all day. Thank you for a wonderful stay!!",

Oversized jetted tub with bath salts to soak your cares away. Spa robes, slippers, comfortable King sized bed, essential oil diffuser and water fountain. A professional T3 hairdryer, Tushy Bidet and Muscle Gun. \n\nClose to all the local attractions LancasterCounty has to offer yet tucked away on a quiet road in the midst of peaceful  Amish country.\n\n\n.",
    "space": "The Loft is a spacious studio apartment located above our detached garage. Featuring unique architecture and plentiful skylights letting in the natural light. King size bed, sitting area, dining area and kitchenette with Mini Fridge, Microwave, Toaster Oven, and Hot Plate. Keurig coffee pot as well as traditional drip and a pour over option. We provide coffee and creamer. \n\nWe do not have TV as we would rather you focus on connection. There is a jet pack hotspot for WiFi connection and a Bose Radio/CD player. \n\nWe are exited to offer our newly completed (Spring 2022) backyard Garden Patio for our guests.  Relax and enjoy your coffee in the peaceful Amish countryside listening to the birds and the soothing sound of the water fountain, watching the Amish buggies go by. Curl up in the egg chair with a good book. Eat your chicken bbq from our Amish neighbors at the bistro set. Bask in the golden sunset roasting s’mores over the tabletop fireplace or if you prefer the crackling ambiance of wood, there’s that option too. A truly gorgeous relaxing spot to relax in tranquil Amish country. PLEASE NOTE the backyard Garden Patio is a shared space with guests that may have booked The Cottage over your same dates. \n\nOver two dozen purifying house plants as well as the soft glow of a Himalayan salt lamp and bubbling fountain add to the ambience. \n\nI am all about natural health so you will not find air fresheners or strong scented candles in my units. \n\nYou can rest assured we strive for spotless cleanliness. In the unit you will find a high quality air purifier so you can feel completely safe staying in our space.   \n\nMore about the space…The Loft was once the hayloft for Ammon’s Amish grandfather whose horse and buggy were housed below. Ammon who works in construction, turned it into a lovely open sanctuary with nine skylights and eight windows.",

You will see our Amish neighbors walking, pushing scooters or in their buggies using the farm lane directly beside the cottage or working in their farm fields beside us.",
    "neighborhood": "We are just minutes away from many local attractions. The town of Intercourse is famous for Kitchen Kettle Village and AAA Buggy Rides. Rockvale Square and Tanger Outlets, Strasburg Railroad, Dutch Wonderland Amusement Park, Sight and Sound Theater are all within a few miles while we remain hidden on a back country road.\n\nFamous Amish cooking restaurants such as Bird In Hand Family Restaurant, Miller’s Smorgasbord, Dienner’s Country Restaurant and Katie’s Kitchen are all nearby for your enjoyment and convenience.",

We had a bad storm come through and Kelly was very thoughtful and checked in to make sure we were okay. Wish we could have stayed longer but we were only in the area briefly. Beautiful area. Also the recommendations were very helpful, including the Rawlinsville Brick House restaurant and the nearby overlook of the Susquehanna River. Just a terrific experience.",

Kelly had muffins waiting for us and a list of suggestions of what to do in the area; she had thoughtful touches throughout the house. \nThe posting lists that the home is near Sight and Sound. I wished I would have looked more closely because it is 30 minutes from that location and about 30-45 minutes away from anywhere that we wanted to go. I take responsibility for not double checking the location in regards to where we were going though. Kelly was great to work with and I am glad that we had the opportunity to stay in this beautiful farmhouse.",

  "description": {
    "summary": "Welcome to the Stone House at Beaver Creek located in beautiful Lancaster County.\n\nThis historical home built in 1840 has been fully renovated with all modern conveniences. It boasts 3 bedrooms, 2 full bathrooms, 1 half bath, and sleeps up to 8 guests. It is fully furnished throughout with everything you'll need for a relaxing stay or family vacation.\n\nCome and relax in the cool breeze on Beaver Creek or kick back with a book. Enjoy the beautiful views, peace, and tranquility.",
    "space": "The Fisher family, who reside on the Amish  farm across the street, are the proud owners and caretakers of this charming residence. Originally constructed in 1840 by early settlers seeking to establish themselves near Martinsville Village and Beaver Creek, this two-story dwelling was crafted from creek bed stone and surrounded by farmland. The rich soil, plentiful timber, water sources, and wildlife helped the settlers thrive.\n\nNotably, it is one of the few surviving structures from the area's earliest days, with the original well still standing beside it, thoughtfully safeguarded to prevent accidents. \n\nDuring the 1890s, the Pennsylvania Railroad Company laid tracks through the villages and farms using eminent domain. The route remained active for nearly a century until its removal in the 1980s. The land was gradually returned to the farming families, and the Stone House's property was the last to be repurchased this year. The bridge supports in the creek behind the home and the graded earth where the tracks once lay are a reminder of the railroad's presence.\n\nIn the 1950s, an extension containing a kitchen and dining room was added to the Stone House, and in 2020, it underwent a complete renovation. After serving as a private vacation residence for two years, it was purchased by Isaac and Linda Fisher.\n\nThe Fishers extend a warm welcome to visitors and are available to assist with any needs that may arise during your stay.",
    "access": "Guests have access to the property except for the nearby sheds. Beaver Creek is also accessible during times of low water but please be mindful of the steep slopes and slippery rocks. If the water is high or running fast please do not attempt to ford the stream. Fishing is allowed if you obtain a Pennsylvania fishing license. Please always be vigilant and take the highest safety precautions.",
    "notes": "Bedrooms 2 and 3 on the 2nd floor are small as this is located in the original stone house. The Master bedroom has ample room. \n\nFrom time to time, the Fisher family may need to access the basement of the home. However, the egress is outside so they will enter from the cellar doors and leave you undisturbed. \n\nIn addition, locals will sometimes fish on Beaver Creek. The bridge serves as a public access point. They will remain on the creek and not enter the property. If there is every a problem, please let us know.",
    "neighborhood": "Located in Rural Lancaster County on Big Beaver Creek. Resides on a quite road with a few neighbors and farms.",
    "transit": "The gravel driveway has enough parking for 4 vehicles.",
    "interaction": "We are here to help if you need anything but will leave you to your privacy. Please reach out to Joshua, the property manager at the posted numbers or through Airbnb. In case of emergency always dial 911. The local fire department is only minutes away.",
    "house_rules": "1.\tQuiet hours: Between 10 pm and 7 am.

We thoroughly enjoyed the pool and being in a private area with beautiful surroundings. We had 10 people with us and it was roomy enough for everyone but would have liked to of had more furniture on the first floor so everyone could have sit together or at least not on the floor. Overall, would stay at Brooke's place again.",

They went out of their way to help with our perfume sensitivities, cleaning the house and bedding with unscented products prior to our arrival.\nThe house was ideal for our family of eight with plenty of privacy for all, and a beautiful private setting. We came for the hiking but found other attractions such as paddle boarding at Lake Laura, evening swims in the pool and music by the fire pit, visiting the Caverns and a fun eclectic general store, John Henrys, which kept us in vintage puzzles and wholesome snacks.\nHighly recommend this airbnb for an active family.",

Cozy throws on couches too making it feel just like home. Plenty of quality towels and wash clothes. Kitchen well stocked with basics including a crock pot. Fridge in garage was perfect for overflow drink items from kitchen. We bought plastic cups to avoid washing glasses all weekend. Home could use two more table height chairs for dining table but we just used bar stools and made it work. There is even a small fridge at the pool that we used for keeping drink while we swam. Dogs loved the yard and we felt safe having them in the yard. Beautiful weekend in a great house.",

All ages enjoyed the foosball, table shuffleboard, & checkers table. We never turned tv on,  but if you like movies there are literally 2 bins of dvds! Tracy was lovely to work with  and very responsive!",

We didn’t know what to expect given that 6 adults and 6 children would be under one roof for a whole long weekend. Immediately upon arrival, the home surpassed our expectations. It was spacious and had more than enough room for our group. The basement was filled with movies and games (corn hole, shuffle board, huge checkers and more). The fire pit out back was a major hit for everyone, especially the kiddos who got to try s’mores for the first time! The home was fairly close to Seven Springs and we were able to take the kids there for 2 of the days during our stay. We couldn’t have asked for more! Great home, amazing and gracious host and an insanely peaceful property. Thank you Tracy!",

The home isn't perfect - sloping floors , some of the furniture (couches/chairs) are a little worn, and the kitchen is starting to show its age... some to be expected given home's age. The pond was rarely usable too with algae (though the wind at times would allow us some fishing). But none of this got in the way of our family truly enjoying the amazing property. We took full advantage of the ping pong and pool and the hot tub (nice and clean).  But perhaps biggest underrated feature of the home is the front porch with nice/new rocking chairs  - when not gathered around the dining room table for dinner or cards, countless hours were wasted here with good conversation and reading. The house is extremely clean and even in the August heat, was VERY cool inside.  The family all agreed our stay was a \"home run\" and we hope to make a return visit.",

Not too far from Charlottesville, and seemed like there were several cute little towns closer that would have been fun to explore if we had the time. Also only 10 minutes from the airport. Would 100% stay here again!",

    "summary": "Our home is ideal for families/large groups! Tucked away in the heart of Virginia’s wine country, Guildford Farm welcomes you with cozy rooms, beautiful views, and peaceful relaxation. We are located just 15-30 minutes from local wineries, 20 miles from the University of Virginia, and 10 miles from the Shenandoah National Park.",
    "space": "This spaced used to be our family home (and we still gather here from time to time for special occasions!) so please treat it kindly. We ask that you treat our home with as much respect as you would treat your own. If an accident does occur, we ask that you let us know as soon as possible so we can get it taken care of.\n\nOur home was built in the 1790. In 2003, the nearly 8,000 square foot country home was completely restored. The home contains 7 bedrooms, 5 bathrooms, 10 foot ceilings, and a stunning 13 original fireplaces (not suitable for use). During the restoration, the original architecture of the home was meticulously preserved. The inside of the home offers exquisite woodwork, hand-carved mantels and wide heart pine floors.

We wanted to escape the 4th of July fireworks and this location was excellent for that. Being a film buff, my husband was impressed by the For Your Consideration collection available at the cottage. We would love to return to this Airbnb location in the fall or even make it a yearly tradition.",

    "space": "Escape and unwind from city life on a beautiful and historic estate just 20 minutes from Charlottesville! Our historic bungalow comfortably fits 2-4 people and is perfect for those who just want to take a step back and enjoy the wonder nature has to offer! \n\nThis cottage was originally the Summer Kitchen for the Main House at Green Springs. The fireplace works wonderfully and has its original hardware!",
    "access": "The bungalow is located on a historic 255 acre estate with 2 ponds (one right outside your rental), a creek, and a lake! Feel free to walk around and explore. We have bikes, fishing poles, croquet, a hammock!\nYour cottage has the address that is listed on the description, #147",
    "notes": "This is a historic home dating around the late 1700's, so it's old! And we want our guests to enjoy all the charm its age brings with it, but we do expect guests to treat the home with care and absolutely no smoking or candles.\n\nWelcome to Green Springs! \n\nJust a couple of things to mention so you can fully enjoy your stay on the farm. \n\n1. The back light is motion sensor, but the front light is manual. The switch is right next to the front door. \n\n2. Watch your head going up the stairs! The clearance is low. \n\n3. We do NOT have cable, but provide lots of DVDs, and if there isn't anything to your liking, text us and we can bring some more options over. \n\n4. There is WIFI \n\n5. Close all gates you open so that the cows stay where they're supposed to stay. Be mindful of where you step because there will be cow pies. \n\n6. It's about a 20 minute hike to the Lake. You will have to cross a creek (that can get high after a big rain). There is absolutely NO swimming-no humans or dogs. It's a private shared lake among the neighbors. \n\n7. Being in the country, there are a fair share of spiders, ticks, bugs, and animals. Just be aware of your surroundings. \n\n10. When checking out, please turn off both ACs and let us know that you have left.\n\n11. If there is ANYTHING that you need, please text/call/carrier pigeon/knock on the door.

You must pick up after them. \n\n2. If you're planning to leave the cottage for an extended amount of time, your pet must be in a crate (that you bring) or taken with you. They cannot stay in the cottage unattended (it's a historic home and we don't want anything to be damaged).\n\n3. No pets in the pool at all. Ever. \n\n\n\nThank you!! And we look forward to having you here!",
    "neighborhood": "We are in historic Green Springs conveniently located 20 minutes from Charlottesville, 20 minutes from Gordonsville and Orange.\n\nGordonsville transports you to a small town in England where you can stroll the downtown Main St and pop into the local shops. It's also home to The BBQ Exchange (some of the best BBQ in Virginia). \n\nOrange is equally as quaint but a tad bigger town with great antique shopping and rich Civil War history and activities. \n\nThere are in a range of 30-40 minutes great wineries that not only serve great wines but also have great food pairings to make your visit and outing memorable. \n\nThis region of Virginia and our estate is situated in the historic time period of our founding fathers , and you will be not far away to visit some of these presidents homes.  \nWe're very close to James Madison's Montpellier and Thomas Jefferson's Monticello, plus lots of other historical destinations!\n\nWe,  moved 5 years ago to the area and we feel positively overwhelmed with all there is to do!",
    "transit": "You will need a car to access all the wonderful things to do in the area!",
    "interaction": "We love to meet new people, but if you're here trying to unwind and relax and rather not interact, you never have to meet us! \n\nYou'll see us running around the property, but don't be shy. Come talk to us- we love nothing more!",

We appreciated the notes in the entry and kitchen.  The large open basement was a perfect space for our children to play.  John welcomed our children and also our relatives residing in the area.  John was so kind to set up a pool for the kids.  Our children loved the goats and were so excited to get to feed and hold a young one.  John and his family made the last night a remembered occasion with his lovely daughter giving pony cart rides and John offering horse-guided rides.  Our little three-year-old calls it our farm home.  It will definitely be our destination when visiting our son, even without the extras.  We were blessed.",

The simplicity of being on a real Amish Property brought much joy and peace.   There was lots of space for us to spread out and my grandson loved the baby goat he was able to play with and they were so kind as to give him pony rides which he loved.  We were treated like friends and that meant so much.   The location was right in the middle Of beautiful Amish Country.   Nothing was too far.    Our favorite thing to do is drive through the countryside looking at the immaculate properties and stopping for fresh flowers and produce along the way.  Don’t hesitate to stay here.  You won’t be disappointed.",

This place is perfect for unwinding and getting out of the busy city for a few days to just enjoy peace, quiet and nature ! The WiFi was very spotty because of remote location , it didn't bother us since we wanted to be off the grid , but just be aware in case you need to be online for anything. \nWe will definitely stay here again!",

Even with storms that came through we still enjoyed the cozy cottage. We did lose WiFi for a few hours because of that but it was time to unplug and get away anyway! Just be prepared for no cell service. \n\nOne thing to note- if you have back issues, while the bed is very soft and comfy, it was not good for people with back issues and I had to deal with that so in the future I’d look for a travel firm mattress topper. \n\nAlso be prepared that you are in nature and there are bugs!

And there was plenty of room for all 11 of us to hang out in the kitchen/dining area. The bedrooms were quite spacious too. And the 5th bedroom across the driveway from the house was an added bonus since we had a last minute addition to our group. The only issue we had was with finding the house. GPS sent us down a road that ended up at a closed gate, and we had to back up all the way to the road entrance because there was nowhere to turn around. So don't go down any road that doesn't have a road sign. And I wouldn't suggest arriving after dark if you haven't visited before. It's very dark and signs are harder to read. But once you know the area, it's not a problem. And the roads leading to the house are so picturesque. We'd definitely stay here again! Also, the lack of WiFi was not a problem for us. As long as someone was able to get internet using a hotspot we were good.",

In today's day & age, it would have been ideal to have internet, because the phone service was ok, but it will depend on which company you have.  The host said that there's no wifi, but that a phone could be set up as a hot spot.  I wish I had their phone company, because my phone had ok coverage in the kitchen area, but in the upstairs bedroom where I stayed, coverage was very poor.  I only had to walk halfway down to the other end & had coverage - strange!\nMy family mentioned that they didn't like the stuffed animals (personally, not a problem for me), so if that's something you are uncomfortable with, take note.  \nEverything seemed clean & orderly.  Lots of little details.  \nA 10 AM check-out is a little early.  I wish it could have been 11 or noon since check-in was 3 or 4pm.  Hotels usually have it set up this way, with check-out no earlier than 11 .",

We met while attending the University of Virginia and we got married and lived in Charlottesville after graduating. We love Charlottesville but just needed more space for our kids to run so we built our home in Crozet. We spend a lot of time in the nearby area of Afton along Route 151 going on hikes, visiting the local breweries and vineyards - all the things we recommend to our guests to do! We not only own the spaces that we rent out to our amazing guests but we spend time in those spaces as a family. I am a Realtor at Nest Realty and being a super host has been an avenue of real estate that I enjoy. We built and remodeled our properties and take a lot of pride in them to attract our guests to our little slice of heaven in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. ",

Easy walk to everything downtown, sidewalks, streetlights and so on.  It's also almost as easy to walk to Old Trail, so the home is in a really great spot.  Inside, it felt like a perfect little farmhouse, smartly built to feel private and secluded. Really can't wait to stay there again.",

    "space": "*COVID UPDATE: Cleanliness is more important than ever. To help reduce the spread of COVID-19, we’ve put together cleaning guidelines based on recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that our cleaners are implementing after every guest. With the extent of the extra cleaning measures, we can NOT accommodate any early check-in or late check-out requests.  We are also NOT interested in renting our space out to long term guests more than 8 days.\n\nWhether visiting family or friends in the area, attending a wedding or event or just getting away for a great experience you'll find your happy place at The Barn at Haden. If you enjoy staying in a place that has all the conveniences of your own home, that's how we designed the space. It features, a fully equipped kitchen with dishwasher, microwave, stove/oven, farmhouse sink, full size refrigerator and quartzite countertops. The oversized island will surely be the hangout spot in the space. A full size dining table is offered for meals. The family room offers a large HDTV. There's a laundry room with washer and dryer and both bedrooms have their own closets with hangers. The 2nd bedroom can be created by closing the two 4' barn doors and pulling down the double size murphy bed. If you are a guest that only needs one bed, then the barn doors remain open for an additional sitting room to retreat to. There's an abundance of natural light thru every window but the lights you do need to turn on are powered by solar energy in the home. There is a separate exterior staircase that leads to an oversized elevated deck for enjoying mountain views. \n\nWe are equipped for children! The space includes a pack n' play (bring your own crib sheet), infant bathing tub, step stool for the bathroom sink and a small basket of toys/books to keep small children entertained. There is also a full size playground within walking distance down the street in the Old Trail Neighborhood.\n\nWe do not accept short term or long term rental requests. Please no inquiries for this!",
    "access": "Guests will have access to the entire apartment that offers free high speed internet via WIFI. There is an assigned parking spot in the driveway for guests and if traveling with more than one vehicle, we do have additional off street parking areas in our driveway.",
    "notes": "Parties of 4 will be an additional $30/night.\n\nPlease indicate when you make your reservation if you will need the 2nd bedroom prepared for your reservation. We will assume parties of 3-4 will definitely need the 2nd bedroom. Otherwise the 2nd bedroom will be staged as a sitting room if it is not needed. Please also indicate if you will need the infant crib set up prior to your arrival along with the high chair. \n\nCheck-in time is 3:00PM.\n\nThere is a unique code to access the front door lock. You will receive your custom code that will be good for the duration of your stay. There is no need for us to meet you to let you in and you can arrive/depart whenever you would like to.",

He left the light on for us in the cottage so we could find our way there. Byron and Deanna also left snacks and fresh farm eggs, which were a nice addition.",

Whether you want a catered meal by the host, a relaxing afternoon on the front porch watching Amish buggies go by, or cooking a meal in the well-equipped kitchen…they’ve got you covered!! Our group slept soundly and enjoyed having our own private bathrooms. We were even able to have dinner with the Amish neighbors one night…what a treat!  The beautiful home is rich with history and we enjoyed reading all about it. Watching the goats and chickens was also fun!  We highly recommend!!!",

I reside in Ivy, VA with my wife Jill of 22 years and our 4 children. \n\nWe recently purchased the old Page Family Farm in Nellysford, VA.  The original house on the farm dates back to the 1840’s. The Farm consists of two cottages and the main farmhouse. \n\nAs a family we’ve been working together to bring this ole farm back to life. Our 4 kids (16,14,9,8) have been hard working this summer to get things ready for our guests. \n\nI have a background in Landscape Design and construction. We have a master plan of turning this farm into one of the premier venue destinations in the area. Check back often for photo updates and additional Airbnb homes.\n\n\nThank you for sharing your vacation and getaway time with our family. If we can do anything to make your stay more comfortable or special never hesitate to let us know. \n\nThanks Y’all!\n\nThe Snow Family",

The farmhouse was charming. Everything was as described/pictured. The house was stocked well. Though, our dog found a poison mouse trap and tried to get into it -  we put it out of her (and my toddler’s) reach. \n\nDuring our stay, a tub in one of the bathrooms did not drain properly and leaked into the dining room. We contacted the host immediately and they apologized for the inconvenience, but didn’t send anyone out to look at it. In full transparency, I would have given our stay a better rating, but a week after our stay, Corbin requested $2,800 in damages to replace the drywall from the leak, claiming the tub overflowed (it did not) and there was faulty plumbing. The incident and request for damages is currently under review by AirBnB. I hope we are not responsible for the damages. In the meantime, it’s a cautionary tale.",

Modern furnishings, temperature controls, kitchen, but a classy traditional aesthetic. Would stay there again.",

The authentic farm property presented a beautiful garden, farm animals, and well kept yards and buildings.  The apartment above their home is ready for use, provides satisfying accommodations, and offers nice furnishings and comfortable beds for a restful and relaxing vacation.  The wide-open kitchen features a floor made of historic planks and has standard appliances and plenty of cabinet space for storing groceries.  It was a real treat for my family of five to step into the Thyme Farm, as it took us back from our familiar ways.",

The suite was very clean, well stocked, and comfortable. It is a cozy old farmhouse that has been very well taken care of.    The exterior of the property was beautiful. Very well kept and landscaped!  What you see in the photos is real but does not show the extent of the property. Excellent location and super quiet and peaceful.  There is nothing that we were disappointed in about the property.  We hope to stay there again next year as this will be a yearly trip for us for mission meetings. So, if you like what you see in the photos and its available, book now! You will not be disappointed!",

The appartment is on the second floor of their farmhouse, but it feels like you have the whole place to yourself. It is very spacious and private, although outside space is shared.\n\nWe explored the farm with the kids, they liked to see the animals up close and we enjoyed the peace and quietness of the countryside. Since it was winter we did not try the swimming pond, but it looked impressive.\n\nThe place was very cozy and comfortable. Suzanne and her husband Matt have nicely renovated the place while keeping the old atmosphere. Everything was very clean and tidy.\nWe hope to stay here again if we visit the area in the future.",

There were a few areas in the house that could have used a bit more cleaning before we showed up, such as a couple of the bathrooms but otherwise the house was nice and clean.

He is very flexible and made the the booking process, as well as checking in and out seamless and easy.  We were a large group visiting for UVA graduation, and the house was perfect for our party. Although the furnishings within the home are dated, it didn't matter as the view and land are the highlights.  Loved building fires in the pit and watching the gorgeous sunset. The beds are very comfortable, the AC was excellent, and plenty of hot water - so all the necessities were covered. We are forever grateful to Ned for sharing his beautiful farm and allowing us to experience an amazing weekend!",
