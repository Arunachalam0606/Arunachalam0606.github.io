You enter through a quaint walled courtyard in the back of the castle and follow the blue doors into your apartment. The beautiful walled private outdoor area is perfect for letting your kids play without worrying they’ll wander off, and the space has everything you could need. The host greeted us and was so friendly and great with our kids. We enjoyed the local walking trail, and we met the super friendly neighbor who gave us a tour of the absolutely stunning gatehouse bridge you cross on the way to the castle. The river was so fun for the kids, and John provided a fishing pole and my son was thrilled to catch a crawfish! As we walked the grounds back to the apartment, we saw what seemed like the largest tree In Scotland! It was like a small sequoia! The apartment was comfortable, clean and so fun to experience after touring castle ruins and castle museums! Highly recommend!",

The large dining room allowed us to hire a chef via the Supper Chefs sites to cook for us one evening .\nWe had the BEST host ever!  Ana Maria made us feel welcomed before we got there and even after we left. She made sure we had all info we needed for our stay, was very clear and promptly responded our questions, and provided great recommendations for day trips, shopping, etc.\nBOTTOM LINE, the only downside was leaving and not booking more days there. We are comining back for sure for Part 2!",

We spent many hours near the pool and enjoying the Castle grounds.\n\nThe castle itself was lovely, with lots of character and many details to explore. Ammenities were as described, and we'll updated considering the age of the property. Showers were warm and had good water pressure. Clothes dried quickly in the sun on the clothesline. \n\nBugs can get bad near dusk due to proximity to the river, so we'd recommend guests get some bug spray at the local Continente, which is very close. If anything else is needed during your stay, like extra pool towels, the store is very close and easy to get to!\n\nEverything was lovely and we hope to come back in the future!!",

To stay in our own castle in Ireland is something some only dream of and I’m so blessed it worked out. And Karen was the best host! She introduced us to her 6, four month old greyhound puppies that my kiddos got to play with, let my kids feed her chickens and horse and was just so kind and welcoming. There were toys in the castle for the kids to play with and on one of the rainy days, my kids had fun playing hide and go seek in the castle, having an amazing tea party in the dining room and playing cards in the parlor. I wish we would have stayed longer-3 nights was not enough! We will be back! Thank you again Karen!!",

Our GPS took us to the wrong place , and when we finally found her, we couldn't wait to get settled as we had been driving all day. However, there was no food, no drink, no wifi.  everything was closed . The castle itself was very musty and cramped with stuff, and our rooms were up flights of stairs . she suggested leaving our luggage downstairs, which I thought was another inconvenience.  I really looked forward to this stay based on listing, but we left the keys and didn't go back .",

And of course, the outdoor spa and fire pit were a welcoming retreat after 18 holes.  Would definitely repeat!",

They have everything you need as far as cookware, plates, bowls, cutlery, etc... The grounds are beautiful. The theatre/ game room/ golf simulator room is amazing! We spent a lot of time in there.",

We were having a few issues on arrival and Tyler and his team were on it so FAST! Everything went smoothly after. The grounds are massive and gorgeous, coming from downtown Milwaukee, we weren’t prepared for how peaceful this castle was going to be! The movie theater was by far my favorite part, the bass is better than any movie theater I’ve been to, and my husband was in love with the salt water hot tub and outdoor deck. The wine tasting hall was GREAT for serving food and having a nice family dinner too. The piano room, I could go on and on about the piano room. You just have to see this place, don’t think, just book! I will absolutely be back, if not to the castle ANY of their other properties. They clearly have a very high standard and they’re sticking to it!",

    "summary": "As seen on the cover of Haven, a luxury home magazine! \n\nThis masterpiece was built over the course of seven years and is officially open to the public in 2022!\n\nFor travelers who want an exclusive taste of Tuscany without the hassle of jetting across an ocean, \"The Castle Vineyard\" is the place to stay. The dramatic, spellbinding stone castle proudly overlooks over twenty acres of idyllic rolling hills and a gorgeous, working vineyard. Once inside, the interior does nothing to dispel the magic.",
    "space": "ACCEPTING 2024 EVENTS! Separate event fees apply. Guests must inquire prior to booking. Exceeding capacity without approval prior to booking results in immediate termination of contract. \n\n\nIntroducing The Castle Vineyard, an exclusive property offered by Wisconsin Getaways, the epitome of premier experiential stays in Wisconsin. With a remarkable portfolio of premier properties and an impeccable rating of 4.99 out of 5.0 from over 400 reviews, Wisconsin Getaways guarantees an unparalleled experience for guests looking for the very best.\n\nGolf cart rental available for $150/per stay. Message us direct for details. \n\nThe castle is a perfect blend of design elements inspired by Tuscan vineyards, castles of Europe, historic Wisconsin barns, mid-century American industry and turn of the century churches. Only the very best material had been chosen with delicate care to create a richly vibrant castle filled with special custom-made pieces. \n\nHome Entry \n\nBefore you even walk into the castle, you are greeted with the arched beauty of the spectacular mahogany and glass front door. This gorgeous arched door was sourced from a professional, Italian door maker who was moving back to Italy. Once you open the door, you are immediately greeted with a gorgeously lit foyer that features an original Milwaukee gas streetlamp. \n\nPiano Room \n\nIn true European style, there is a beautiful piano room which features a miniature baby grand piano hanging above as a chandelier. Little known fact… This exquisite instrument was a retirement gift from General MacArthur to his limo driver. And in case you are wondering, no you do not have to take a ladder to play the chandelier piano! There is a lovely grand piano that our musically inclined guests are welcomed to tinkle away on. \n\nDining Room \n\nBrightly lit with its numerous wooden windows that continue to carry out the castle’s rustic appeal, the dining room is yet another room that oozes country elegance. Handcrafted from a 1914 John Deere two bottom plow, the dining room table comfortably seats eight. Hanging above the table hangs a uniquely crafted dining room light created from a hay trolley. \n\nKitchen \n\nThe open kitchen plan is a luxury not to be understated. You can find church lights in the kitchen and loft area originating from an 1800's church in Plymouth, Wisconsin. But while the decor may be historic, the kitchen equipment is quite the contrary! The kitchen features state-of-the-art Viking kitchen appliances and a 6' x 11' stainless steel kitchen island. Though this beautiful castle may be rustic in personality, its amenities sure aren’t.\n\nBest of all, with the beautiful windows filling up the kitchen walls, you will be able to get lost in the serenity of the rolling hills and vineyards while you cook! \nFun Fact: Legend has it, the sailfish that can be seen in the kitchen, was purchased at an Ernest Hemmingway auction in southern Florida. In the process of shipping the sailfish from Florida to Kohler, all the paperwork of authenticity disappeared. The sailfish hung in the Kohler showroom until the store closed in the early 2000's. The builder of this gorgeous estate bought it on the store's closing day so that this legend will continue to live on. \n\nOffice \n\nWhile it is a given that you need to relax while on vacation, especially when you are staying in an estate as dreamy as this, this stunning estate offers a wonderful office that is sure to inspire productivity. The lighting in this space is second to none. It not only features an original gas streetlamp from Fort Wayne, Indiana, but the water-pulley light above the desk was specifically sourced from a classic wood sawing mill. If there wasn’t already enough history seeping throughout the room, the combination lock safe was purchased at the estate sale of Clifton Edward Tufte, the founder of Road America. \n\nSpiral Staircase \n\nOne of our favorite parts of The Castle Vineyard would be the gorgeous, wooden, spiraling open-plan staircase. The unique branching pattern in the wood of the winding staircase and railings was accomplished by fractal burning… a technique that creates patterns in wood resembling branching or fractal patterns. It adds a whole new dimension to classically elegant, Arcadian beauty. \n\nThe Wine Hall\n\nWine hall? Yes please! \n\nAsides from the presence of amazing wine, the highlights of the hall would be its gorgeous, award-winning 1902 potato plow chandelier. For a true blue, wine country feels to the place, all the wood used for the tables, benches, and barrel shelves were sourced from an original Johnsonville Brat smokehouse's floor joists and the 32 whiskey barrels lining the walls of the Wine Hall are from Maker’s Mark Whiskey in Loretto, Kentucky. Whilst the entire estate is incredibly dignified and well-polished, the castle remains true to its rustic roots with its original barn metal roof ceiling and most interestingly, the door to the wine cellar was the original gun room door off a WWII Battleship!\n\nTheater Room\n\nThis home theater room is a massive highlight for our travelers who are genuine movie lovers. This top-of-the-line movie theater in the tasting room has a twelve seat (three row) setup, an incredibly generous 135” screen and a Dolby 7.2.2 sound system that would be able to make anyone feel like they were truly a part of the movie! Not to mention, with over 600 Blu-ray DVDs you can choose from and a popcorn machine, the film experience in the Castle Vineyard’s theater room is second to none. Think Marcus Cinema, only WAY better!\n\nBedrooms\n\nMain Bedroom: On the first floor you will be able to find the main bedroom. It offers a generous, queen-sized bed and a full-sized bed (built in the 1800's). Leading off the main bedroom is the piano room featuring another pull-out bed, making it the perfect bedroom for late night music sessions!\n\nPrivate Master Loft: Overlooking the main floor is the private master loft with a half bathroom. Wake up in a king-sized bed that overlooks the beautiful grounds. No window treatments are added to keep the natural beauty, but sleep masks are provided to ensure a restful night's sleep!\n\nBasement Bedroom: Generously sized Queen bedroom set with wooden sliding barn door.\n\nBasement Bunk: Two bunks, four beds, each with private curtain treatments! Unique ceiling lights made from the old drive gears of a Caterpillar bulldozer. Wooden walls, paneling, and beds… a truly Arcadian experience not to be missed! \n\nLiving Room\n\nWith the presence of a gorgeous, stone fireplace, you will be in for warm evenings ahead huddling up on those comfy Baker couches. If you look closely at the stone fireplace, you might be able to see the prehistoric figures secretly embedded in the swirling patterns of the fireplace!\n\nBathrooms\n\nOffering 2.5 bathrooms - there are two showers, one soaking tub, a walk-in sauna, three toilets and one urinal across both. Depending on the bathroom experience you would like to have, one bathroom offers a luxurious rustic experience with its wide-open space and lightly painted room, while the other bathroom offers a Tuscan castle experience with its European-style décor and red painted walls.\n\nVineyard\n\nIn the spring of 2021, 400 grapevines were planted in an organic mixture of topsoil, sand, and cow/chicken manure. The stone pillar vineyard features the following grape varieties: Edelweiss, Marquette, Kay Gray, Frontenac, Beta, Valiant, Somerset, Reliance, St. Theresa, Vanessa, and Concord. Come back in 2023 for \"The Castle Vineyard\" wine tastings.\n\nOther\n\nPrivate chef: Is your group looking for a prepared meal to create the ultimate experience? Message directly for options!

The beds were comfortable and the kitchen was well stocked. There are a lot of stairs which was not an issue for us but could be an issue if you have mobility issues. The grounds were stunning as well. You will definitely need a car to get around the area. Highly recommend this unique stay!",

Toni was so nice, flexible, & responsive (& impressive with constantly going up/down the stairs!). The beds were so comfortable; the towels, robes & slippers provided so soft; the thoughtful decor made for a special & unique stay for the entire family. Really luxurious! Main entry is shared but then there is a private entrance to your Tower Apartment up the stairs. As you proceed up the stairs, the Wallace Bedroom is first. Then a few more steps and you have the sitting room (with great Sonos sound system), the pristine & well equipped kitchen, Balmoral room (en suite) and a shared bathroom. Further up the spiral staircase is the cozy cinema room and then still further is the Mary Queen of Scots room and then finally at the top is the spectacular deck - views worth every step! Thank you for a once-in-a-lifetime experience!",

It is one of the 4 foothill villages of the Ochil Hills which are great for hiking.\n\nIn the village you will find a good range of amenities, including shops, a well presented pub and even it's own museum. Castle Campbell, a wonderful place for walking is only 3 miles away with its wonderful scenery as you walk through Dollar Glen and see fantastic views of Dollar below. Just outside the village is the Japanese Garden (Cowden). You will also find ‘Do It Outdoors’ and ‘Lendrick Muir Outdoor Activity Centre’ close by (with loads of fun activities).\n\nKinross is 12 miles away, where Mary Queen of Scots famously escaped from her prison at Lochleven Castle on 2 May 1568. The castle is situated on a small island in the middle of Loch Leven. Alloa Tower is 8 miles away and is one of the earliest and largest Scottish Tower Houses (run by National Trust for Scotland).\n\nThe historic city of Stirling is only 12 miles away, with it’s famous Castle, old prison and Wallace Monument to visit.  If you enjoy castles then why not have a day trip to Blair Castle in Blair Atholl, Scone Castle in Perth (once the crowning palace of Scottish Kings), or Glamis Castle in Angus, the childhood home of the Queen Mother.\n\nFor a boat trip with a difference visit the Falkirk Wheel Visitor Centre (40 mins) and be transported from the Forth & Clyde canal to the Union canal over a 100 feet higher!\n\nAlva Glen and Gartmorn Dam Country Park are in close proximity and are great for walking.  Loch Lomond is about an hour, with its visitor and sealife centre.  There are also shops, cafes and boat trips.\n\nRoman history buffs will be interested in the stretch from the Firth of Forth to the Firth of Clyde.  Here are the remains of the Antonine Wall, the northernmost frontier of the Roman Empire ~ the best preserved length of which is at Bonnybridge.\n\nFor motorsport enthusiasts the famous Knockhill Motorsport Centre is only 8 miles away, either for watching races or testing out your driving skills in classic/racing/rally cars.\n\nFor golfers, visitors are welcome at the local traditional hillside Dollar Golf Club. There are also over 30 golf courses within an hour’s drive including Gleneagles (where there are many other activities such as shooting, falconry, horse riding to name just a few) and St Andrews.\n\nThere is also a Tank Drive Challenge Centre and a Dry Ski Slope centre, both within a few miles of the property.\n\nFor retail therapy there is of course Glasgow and Edinburgh, but closer to Dollar is Tillicoultry (10 mins), home of Sterling Mills outlet village and Sterling Furniture with its homestore, garden centre and restaurants.\n\nEating out:\n\n  Fine dining\n\n> The Glenturret Lalique Restaurant - fine dining restaurant with exceptional food, wine and service. Bar lunches, afternoon tea and whisky tasting available. All in the surroundings of The Glenturret Distillery, Scotland's oldest working distillery, producing single malt whisky by hand since 1763. Pre-book to avoid dissappointment at this Michelin Starred Distillery. 45 minute drive.\n\n> Restaurant Andrew Fairlie - fine dining restaurant within The Gleneagles Hotel, serving a high-end Modern Scottish menu by an acclaimed chef Andrew Fairlie. The Gleneagles resort is renowned as one of the world's finest golfing venues. 3o minute drive.\n\n> Rhubarb Restaurant at The Prestonfield - on the outskirts of Edinburgh, the exquisite interior of this 17th-century manor house is the perfect setting for that special occasion. Romantic fine dining using locally-sourced Scottish ingredients. 1 hour drive.\n\n  Award-winning restaurants\n\n> Barley Bree - a hidden gem in a tradtional setting, not to be missed. A highly rated rustic restaurant serving a French inspired menu, using local Scottish ingedients. 35 minute drive.\n\n> Brea Restaurant - small restaurant based in the heart of Stirling, offering impressive bistrot dining. 25 minute drive.\n\n  Local\n\n> The Inn at Dollar - traditional pub menu in modern and comfortable surroundings. 5 minute drive / 25 minute walk.",

Ulverston is a festival town, with flags, walking, art, and music festivals in the summer and the Dickensian Christmas festival in late November. Stan Laurel was born there, and it holds the world record for the biggest foam pie battle, revealing a joyful, community-minded town. The town and surrounding area offer stunning views of the southern Lake District and Morecambe Bay. Deepest, widest, and shortest canal makes for a great afternoon walk with a pub and bay views.

Being away has given me a fresh appreciation for the beauty and tranquility of the landscape - a million miles away from the increasing urbanisation of the rest of the planet.\r\n\r\nI love to host visitors from all over the world and hope they catch some of the magic of Balintore Castle. It goes without saying I enjoy good conversation, good company and if good food is  involved - so much the better. :-)\r\n\r\nMy top travel destinations are sites of the ancient world and I was recently wowed by Istanbul, staying as an AirBnB guest. I work as a computer programmer, but my interests extend far beyond technology into art, cinema, literature, history, language and yoga! ",

    "summary": "Balintore Castle has been hosting guests since 1860. Located in a remote Highland Glen, it offers direct access to hill walking, mountain biking, bird-watching and shooting. The kitchen wing accommodation has recently been restored in keeping with the high Victorian character of the building. Full self-catering facilities are available.",
    "space": "The holiday accommodation is located in the kitchen wing of the castle. This is the first area that has been brought to full habitability in the initial phase of a restoration program that started in 2007. Accommodation costs will be entirely directed towards further restoration of the castle.",
    "access": "Guests have full and exclusive access to the kitchen wing, but are not allowed in the remainder of the castle which is undergoing restoration and is dangerous. When available,  the owner, housekeeper or builder will be delighted be to show you around the whole building.\n\nNote, there is one other private property in the vicinity of the castle. This is the estate gamekeeper's cottage immediately facing the front of the castle.  Please respect my neighbours' privacy and do not enter their grounds, and do not visit the dogs in their kennels. As a dog lover myself, I can understand the temptation to say hello, but these are working animals and will be upset by any approach.",
    "notes": "You are welcome to bring in external catering If you wish e.g. via the \"La Belle Assiette\" and \"Dine Indulge\" portal website which allows you to contact local chefs. Professional catering facilities are available, and of course you can also self-cater. \nChloe is a local chef who is happy to cater by prior arrangement. Please ask for contact information. \n\nNote that the heating may be off during the summer and periods of warm weather. We appreciate that guests come from all over the world, and may be used to a different climate, so don't hesitate to get in touch if you would like the heating switched on out of season.\n\nExtra beds can be supplied on request.\n\nSpare toilet rolls may be found in the bathroom cabinet.I\n\nThe castle can be easily found: just enter the postcode DD8 5JS into a SATNAV. The last few miles of your drive will be on single track road, so please take care and reduce your speed on blind bends.  Do not use the east drive (through the gate lodges) to approach the castle as the track is very rough. Instead, use the west drive which starts by a large barn, and has a \"Balintore Castle\" sign.\n\nIf you are expecting the perfection of an luxury international hotel chain, then Balintore Castle is not for you! However, if you want a more characterful and \"crumbly round the edges\" experience and to be the house guests of a Highland Laird in a traditional Scottish Castle which once teetered on the brink of dereliction and is still actively being restored, then you will be made very welcome.\n\nSome local recommended eateries:\n\nAirlie Arms, Kirriemuir, 4 St Malcolm's Wynd, Kirriemuir,  DD8 4HB\nArmstrong's Bar & Restaurant, Roundyhill, Glamis, Angus, Roundyhill DD8 1QT\nDrovers Inn Restaurant, Memus, by Forfar, Angus\nLittle's Restaurant 1 Riverside Rd, Blairgowrie PH10 7GA\nGlenisla Hotel, Kirkton of Glenisla, Blairgowrie PH11 8PH\nGlen Clova Hotel, Glenclova, Angus DD8 4QS\nLands of Lloyd Hotel, Alyth\n\nThere are private chefs who have done excellent catering\nfor guests at the castle e.g. Peter who provides \"Chef Number 9 \nServices\", is based nearby in Perth. Please do an online search\nor get in touch for more details.\n\nGuests have also used the \"La Belle Assiette\" and \"Dine Indulge\"\nportals.\n\nChloe is a local chef that is happy to provide catering at the castle by prior arrangement.

      "about": "We are a small but mighty team with our hearts set on sharing with you the most glorious hidden gem in this rural corner of Scotland: Dunskey, a 2000-acre estate by the sea, where world-class heritage meets modern splendour, surrounded by secret gardens and endless wonders. \n\nEverything we do is rooted in our three values: compassion, innovation, and transformation. We strongly believe that the first steps towards spectacular hospitality is taking care of our team and environments. Here, you'll meet the incredible Dunskey stewards who sincerely wish to share with you the joy, beauty, and warmth in all that we do. Most significantly, you will find extraordinary thoughtfulness in every moment of your journey here. \n\nWe are also a feministic company with a laser focus on sustainability. We use re-fillable products wherever possible. Our heating system is nearly at 100% sourced from renewable energy. We compost 100% of our food waste, and our water comes from a fresh spring. We continuously strive to do more and do better.\n\nOur ongoing other projects include policy advocacy in immigration and anti-human trafficking, working on turning out the votes in America and fighting against voter suppression laws. Seeking social and racial justice is a constant, though sometimes painful, anchor in our lives. We would like everyone to read the two novels, The Overstory, by Richard Powers, and, Ministry for the Future by Kim Stanley Robinson. When not heartened by the possibility of collective action to address climate change, we like to cook a ton-load of Vietnamese beef noodle soup and plot the next magic mushroom trail on the Estate.

Open fire to accompany family snooker games in the Billiards Room, deer, red squirrels, ravens and hare in the lovely grounds were all highlights. Very comfortable bedrooms and lovely bathrooms with lots of storage and living space. We barely used the car instead exploring the estate’s lochs, beaches and woods. Anne was very helpful and quick on communications in the run up to our trip and upgraded us to the wonderful East Wing. On site Simon was a very friendly, helpful and attentive aid. Best equipped self-catering kitchen we’ve ever had in a holiday rental. We were left a lovely selection of welcome produce including home baking. Would highly recommend for a special holiday for families, couples or groups.",

Alastair and Anne are the most interesting and incredible hosts (and people): they really want you to feel utterly at home,  and offer wonderful suggestions for exploring the truly magical estate. They are generous in every way.  The interiors are a mix of  old world elegance and contemporary ease - very magical.  All amenities are luxurious.  The gardens, the lochs, the stunning walks to the beach and the sense of space all create a serene and expansive place of relaxation with untold outdoor discoveries.  And the views are nothing short of spectacular. We had one day of snow, one of brilliant sunshine and two rainy days - we loved each for the different moods they brought out of the landscape.  Staff is also top notch and friendly.  Highly recommend and hope to go back.",

    "summary": "Bring alive fairytales in this Edwardian castle at the heart of private 2000 acres of glen walks, forests, 3 beaches, 2 lochs, walled and woodland gardens, maze, and 2 waterfalls. Comes with a stately reception rooms, 25 bedrooms and bathrooms, with luxurious amenities and a dedicated team. An award-winning, all-inclusive catering program is available. We host exclusive use and private events for up to 90 guests. March - September, NY & Xmas requires minimum 40 guests, all other times 26 guests.",
    "space": "Established by a dapper industry magnate and Member of Parliament Charles Lindsay Orr Ewing, Dunskey Castle infuses intelligent luxury and historical romance into every second of your spectacular stay. The Castle, completed at the turn of the century, showcases unrivaled technology of its heyday and historical architecture of enormous proportions. \n\nThroughout the Castle, physical features will bring alive the patriarch's globetrotting influences and the rich history of Scottish merchants at the cusp of the Industrial Revolution. From the iconic Delft tiles that grace the mantelpiece in many bedrooms and social areas, to the outrageously intricate Baronial plaster ceiling, which is deemed culturally significant by the Scottish government. Every moment at Dunskey promises true immersion into history, authenticity, and a perfectly bespoke luxury that befits the Castle's historical grandeur.\n\nThe Baronial Porch pays homage to the Castle's medieval roots by original stoneworks from the 11th Dunskey Castle ruin that still stands dramatically cliffside a few miles down the coast. Its pared-back austerity sharply juxtaposes the entrance foyer, where rich oak panels immediately cocoon guests in warmth and resplendence. Ornate frames of art works original to Castle are displayed throughout the reception rooms, including an ever-growing collection of ceramics, a tribute to Charles Orr Ewing's travels throughout South and East Asia. Inside the Great Hall, the Jacobean fireplace with its impressive curved countenance, bearing the ancient family crest, commands your attention and invites hours of lazing in front of its cracking embers. Offering views of rolling meadows, through the woodlands and as far as the eyes can see to the coast, the Great Hall embodies a quiet magnificence that can sheathe and soothe outward distractions. \n\nIn contrast to the stateliness of the Great Hall, the Victorian Drawing Room recalls silk gloves and calligraphed letters. Sink into sumptuous wool and velvet upholstered armchairs, most of which have been painstakingly restored. Stretch out on our buttery leather four-seat Chesterfield and be seduced by the handcrafted Grecian and Scottish vines and foliage that adorn the ceiling. Or play the liveliest round of Chinese Whisper on our leather-and-grommet Windsor conversational settee. There are few places better for escaping into a book than next to the roaring fireplace, beneath the spectacular floor-to-ceiling mantelpiece painted in the softest of dove gray. Operatic callings may be on the cards with the presence of the 19th-century mahogany pearl-inlaid piano, or if karaoke is more your jam, consider treating it as a station for whisky tasting. \n\nSpeaking of strong tipples, ensconced yourselves at the United Turkey Red Bar, named after the company founded by the Orr Ewing brothers in 1898, to produce their famously passionate and royal red dye. Entirely bespoke to Dunskey Castle, the bar retains its character from the oak wood paneling salvaged from the attic! While perched on gold and velvet barstools, you'll be charmed by maritime artefacts that came from yachts commissioned and built by Charles Orr Ewing, including gilded prints and photographs. The unusual exposed-brick, multi-tier fireplace will transport you to all the ship's rip-roaring follies on the sea once upon a time. Drink up if the ship's bell from HMS Anson is rung out. Charles' son David was a Naval Captain aboard HMS Anson during World War II.\n\nIf it gets too lively at the bar, retreat to the Officer's Corner, a stately homage to the Estate's history and records upon its formation. Here, you'll find an impressive stone-carved fireplace and a fascinating bookcase designed specifically for this quarter. Leather bound and gold embossed volumes of Estate records, crystal ink pots, and mementos from Charles Orr Ewing's globe-circling travels will certainly stir at your own wanderlusts. If that's not quite enough, wool upholstered sofa, throws of sheepskins and velvet armchairs will undoubtedly spur the most intimate parleys. \n\nWander past the main carpeted stairs and towards the art-deco double-door into the main dining room, one of the most romantic spaces in the Castle. An enchanting chandelier evoking golden liquid sunlights and dappling raindrops hang from the intricate plaster ceiling. On all four walls, a custom-designed Chinoiserie mural in shimmering lavender and copper takes you back to gilded Victoriana. At each end of the dining room, the signature painting of suave Charles Lindsay Orr Ewing gazes cooly upon his happy guests, while the portrait of Lady Augusta Hunter Blair smiles coyly. Both paintings have been heavily influenced by the John Singer Sargent aesthetics.\n\nAfter a dizzying feast in the dining room, retire to the library next door. One of the best-kept surprises at Dunskey is the full-size billiard table that is original to the Castle. Lit by four lamps from the 1880s, designed for this specific purpose, the billiard table commands all your attention. Not to be outdone, rows upon rows of antique books, with their embossed spines and leather covers, exude erudition and solemnity. The bespoke design of the book case is truly one of a kind, with its beveled glass doors and elaborate wooden curlicues, echoing art deco influences that were emerging at the turn of the century.\n\n In need of an even cozier place? Head to the Club Room, where you'll find overstuffed couches, TV, and an original wood-fire range in a heritage room decorated with antique collections of sports and travel paraphernalia. The heart of the castle, of course, is in the farm house kitchen with its soaring skylights and A-frame ceilings. Here, a very large space is dedicated for the loveliest roasts in an incredibly well-equipped kitchen.\n\nHead towards Dutch kitchen with our most treasured heirloom at your feet: the carpets, dyed of course with the Turkey Red. Commanding perhaps the best lights and views in the Castle with its double-story windows, the space is named after the blue-and-white Delft tiles that grace the wrought-iron fireplace. Full disclosure, these Dutch tiles with their delightful depictions of a coastal village are exceptionally dear to our porcelain-obsessed hearts. Here, you'll find an antique spinning wheel, rosebud fainting couch, lioness chairs and, improbably, our upstanding bear Wilson, who is at least 140 years old. That should be all you'll need to create your favourite fairy-tale reenactment. \n\nOn the first floor, the first bedroom you'll find is Ella Baker, named after an African American civil rights activist who worked alongside W.E.B Dubois. Hand painted murals and lacquered Chinoiserie panels adorn the indigo walls, showing off a most spectacular gilded ochre bed. The true wow-factor, however, comes from the other-worldly bathroom suite, with its original ceramic and brass bathtub large enough four full size adults, not that we would encourage that sort of frolicking. Moroccan lanterns are suspended above the bath, lending an exotic air to the suite, and contrast beautifully with the hand-glazed teal tiles. Too much to do to contemplate a leisurely soak? Step into our full-size shower, created with great sympathies to preserve all heritage features of the bathroom. \n\nRainbow suite sits across the hall, offering heartstopping views through the fields and to the ocean. Its namesake is the RYS Rainbow, a multi-award-winning schooner that competed in the most exciting international competitions of its days. Keeping true to its seafaring motifs, you'll find lovely coral decor and gold conch lamps throughout the room. We've searched high and low for the mahogany four-poster bed in the suite, and settled on this intricate canopied piece from the early 18th century. Modern comforts won't be compromised though, as a full shower ensuite and a built-in bathtub will ensure you are up to date in luxurious convenience. \n\nThe third bedroom, Orion, often elicit gasps from our guests, particularly those who have always treasured the idea of a gold soaking tub in front of a fireplace. Drawing from the circles in \"Orion\", also named after one of Charles' yachts, a steel and French linen ring canopy bed sits with spherical gilded lamps flanking its side. Get ready for an evening of fine dining in front of the antique dressing table, featuring, you guess it, a circular gold mirror. One of the best parts of the bedroom, of course, is the velvet emerald chaise, encouraging maximum lazing about. \n\nGarden bedroom features a unique view of the vast back lawn, glimpses of the Castle's east wing Baronial architecture, and the woodlands. Here you'll find one of the Castle's original brass beds, restored by us, and outfitted with supremely comfortable mattress, downy duvets, and exquisite linens. A tufted vintage velvet green loveseat ensures ample space for snuggles and reading in this retreat. Featuring the only double-door bathroom in the Castle, you'll be greeted with a built-in bathtub by the bay window, and large shower as always. \n\nAt the end of the corridor, straight ahead, is Glen. It was part of the corridor many years ago, we suppose, but has always been a cozy bedroom in living memory. In fact it was the current owner's childhood bedroom. How does that all fit in a corridor you might ask - let's just say our corridors are rather wide. In those days it didn't have a bathroom but it does today, beautifully appointed around a green glazed tile fireplace. Your view is of the forests and you'll dream of the nature abundant in them.\n\nAt the end of the corridor on the right is the Oak suite. It seems like you could almost touch the massive sweet chestnut right outside your bedroom window. Look closely for the red squirrels running up and down its gnarled old trunk and sometimes up and down the house itself. The squirrels may be red but the unusual paneled walls are a luxurious grey. Lying in the bathtub is perfect vantage point to take in the forest canopy but if you can't spare the time for the tub the high pressure shower has instant hot water. \n\nWe have finally arrived at the Morroch, the grandest and most awe-inspiring room of all. This expansive suite is guaranteed to take your breath away with its infusive lights streaming from every corner. A brass and velvet four-poster superking bed awaits you. A reclaimed carved pine Colonial sofa in French linen and fringe dove velvet chairs creates a romantic atmosphere. To enhance the grandeur, a statement cream Victorian mirror armoire with full length mirror makes sure you look resplendent from every angle. Not to be outshined, the opposite wall features a splendid two-tier Chateau dressing table, a piece so gorgeous designed we have little difficulty lingering by its side. And of course, one of the most phenomenal bathrooms in the Castle resides here. Truth be told, the bathroom itself is slightly larger than our first studio apartment in Manhattan! We won't tell you everything about it, for a little intrigue goes a long way, and you'll best experience the wow-factor first hand when you arrive.\n \nNow don't get lost as you continue down the corridors and pass through a gallery of historical paintings and pictures, proudly showcasing the castle's roots. The first bedroom in the East Wing, Sunset Hill, faces the woodlands that lead to the loch. A handpainted mural of Marrakech and a linen-and-steel canopy bed will transport you to dreamiest destinations. A large en-suite bathroom here features a built-in-tub right by the window, affording the loveliest views of the woods.\n\nNext door is one of the most romantic bedrooms in the Castle, Heartsease, named after one of the superyachts built by the Estate's patriarch. Restored damask chaise lounges right beneath the enormous bay windows, providing exceptional views of the fields and to the ocean, means you have the best seat in the house. The bathroom with its large shower and claw-foot bathtub on an elevated platform will provide stunning views of the matured trees outside.\n\nBlair bedroom is one of the largest in the Castle. It features a super king bed with an upholstered headboard with velvet fabric from the Designers' Guild Collection. Antique furniture are plentiful in this bedroom, and you'll find quite possibly the largest shower here as well.\n\nAdjacent to Blair bedroom is Abdiel, a beautiful paneled bedroom with views to the ocean. It is a smaller room with an ensuite shower, but is grand in its hand-carved bed, artworks original to the Castle, and a beautiful fireplace.  \n\nWe can go on to describe every inch of Dunskey to you, and it still would not to do justice. Countless rooms and spaces still await your discovery and exploration, including the movie theatre, magic parlour, yoga and art studio, and so much more. ",

It was primarily built as a family home and so despite having its origins set in the 1300s, you can expect all the home comforts of a spacious modern house. I hope you have a lovely time absorbing the historical atmosphere and the beautiful countryside surroundings.",

    "summary": "Dairsie Castle is a unique self-catered property which sleeps 14. Located close to St. Andrews (15 minutes drive) and Edinburgh (1 hour drive), it is an ideal setting for a holiday to explore the heart of Scotland.",
    "space": "First sited in the 12th Century, Dairsie has been the location of secret Scottish parliaments, military sieges, and safe haven for escapee monarchs (James VI and I in 1583). The castle became a ruin in the 19th Century. In 1992 it was bought and rebuilt by the current owner who worked hard to restore the castle to its original medieval character, with all the comforts of a modern family home. \n\nThe Castle\n\n‘The Dungeon' - On the ground floor there is a twin bedroom with a vaulted ceiling and ensuite bathroom. \n\n'The Family Bedroom' - This huge master bedroom has 3 four-poster beds; 1 king-size, 2 large singles. The en-suite bathroom is complete with a stand-alone bath and window shutters, painted in the style of Hokusai.\n\n‘The Spottiswoode (Upper Tower Room)’ - Named after one of the long-term residents of the castle, John Spottiswoode, the Archbishop of St. Andrews in the 1600s. This bedroom has a double bed and an ensuite bathroom.\n\n‘The Learmonth (Lower Tower Room)’ - Named after the family that owned Dairsie for a 100 years, before they sold it to Archbishop Spottiswoode in 1616. This bedroom has a double bed and an ensuite bathroom.\n\n‘The South Caphouse’ - A twin bedroom on the top floor at the end of the Gallery. It has a shared shower room with the North Caphouse bedroom, with a small compact shower unit.\n\n‘The North Caphouse’ - This double bedroom is at the opposite end of the Gallery, at the top of the spiral staircase. It has a shared shower room with the South Caphouse Bedroom, with a small compact shower unit.\n\nThe Great Hall – As the hub of the castle, with a dining table which can seat 12, and is surrounded by beautiful artworks and sculptures.There are two large sofas and a foot stool around the fire place for post-dinner relaxation. A Minstrel’s Gallery which over-looks the Great Hall which can be reached from a staircase behind the room.\n\nThe Kitchen – The kitchen has all the usual culinary equipment and has a 2-hub Aga cooker. The room has a table and chairs and is large enough also to be used as a breakfast room. Behind the kitchen is a laundry room with a washing machine and dryer, and adjacent to the kitchen is a washroom.\n\nThe Living Room – The living room is on the 2nd floor, situated next to the Family Bedroom. It is carpeted and has a TV and comfortable sofas. Next door to the living room is a small Toy Room which is filled with children’s books, toys and some board games for the evenings.\n\nThe Gallery – The Gallery is a spacious area on the top floor of the castle and is where a lot of the castle’s artwork and antiques are displayed. It is a very bright and large space with good views of the surrounding countryside.\n\nDairsie has 6 acres of grounds including a cop with a woodland walk down to the river Eden, a walled herb garden, an orchard and a large open grass area. There is an open garage, a watch tower and a large drive which can park a maximum of 15 cars. The castle's caretaker lives next door. \n\nIt is a truly unique property seeped in Scottish history, and one which we welcome you to experience and enjoy!",
    "neighborhood": "There is so much to see and do in the local area! \n\nFor golf enthusiasts, the famous Old Course in St. Andrews and Kingsbarns are both close by, whilst Carnoustie and Gleneagles courses are less than an hour away. \n\nFor family fun, there is Craigtoun Country Park (Nature & Adventure Play Park), The Deer Centre, the Secret Bunker, and Deep Sea World.\n\nYou can spend a day exploring St. Andrews, where you can find the old Cathedral and castle, go on a distillery and tasting tour at the Eden Mill, and walk along the West Sands beach. For some history, Scone Palace in Perth, and Glamis Palace near Forfar are a drive away. You could also spend a day exploring Edinburgh and all it has to offer.\n\nThe Michelin-starred Peat Inn is also worth booking for a delicious meal.",
    "transit": "The best way to get around is by car. There is enough parking space in front of the castle to park max. 15 cars.\nThe castle is about 10mins drive from Leuchars and Cupar train stations. There are usually taxis at Leuchars station. \nThe castle is 20mins walk to Dairsie village which has a village shop, petrol station and a pub.",
    "house_rules": "No functions or events\nNo fireworks \nNo parking on the grass\nNo glitter indoors\nPlease recycle properly (otherwise the council won't collect the bins!)\nThere should only ever be a maximum of 14 people on the grounds or in the property at any time. This means that you may not invite extra people for drinks, dinner, to look around the property etc so that it would exceed 14 people.",

      "about": "John A. Lavender II - owner of Highlands Castle. \n \nHighlands Castle was born from a promise I made to my young son...\n“Someday I’ll build a house where we both will live… a place we’ll call home. \nA place where you can bring your friends and create special memories… someday Jason I will build you a castle.\" \n\nLooking back to 1978, my 3-year old son would likely have never remembered these words. The promise had more to do with a desire to build a better life, than an actual castle.  \n\nIt would be another 5-years before the ideal property presented itself, a mountaintop in Bolton Landing, NY.  \n\nWhile clearing the land for the foundation, a picture was being painted with a chain saw rather than a brush.  Within a matter of weeks, the most spectacular view in the world was uncovered.  The majesty of Lake George and the Adirondack Mountains seemed as grateful as I was to be unveiled.  How was it, that I would be the one to settle here?  Was it simply luck or something much greater? I believe it was the latter, and that I was led to this specific spot for a reason. \n\nOnce the foundation was completed, the wood framing construction was to the roof in a few months and the structure began to find its outward appearance.  I finally graduated from the living quarters of a tent to a mattress on the floor, which was fine with me… I was quite happy to be sleeping in my own home.\n\nIn 1986, I met Yvonne, the woman who 'turned a pile of rocks into a home'.  We were married here in 1992, and my parents who were both Methodist pastors officiated our ceremony.  (In 2008, my son Jason & Mary would be married at Highlands Castle with his grandparents also officiating their wedding). \n\n\"Jason, I promised that I would build you a castle, I didn't say you wouldn't be helping me!\"...  So, when Jason was a teenager, he joined in the stonework.  Naturally resourceful, he recruited his football teammates to lend some muscle over the summer months. Their daily mantra was \"Let's rock!\" and they took great pride in what they accomplished while working together again as a team.  (Jason was not only an impressive stonemason, but he also went on to earn an Architectural Engineering Degree, and achieve anything he put his mind to).\n\nThe stonework was a slow, tedious process and the labor of laying up more than 1,000 tons of local granite would take decades. Over the past 40+ years, the property would evolve into what it is today... a series of three castles.\n\nIn 2010, my wife Yvonne and I decided to make Highlands Castle available so others could experience what our family has been so fortunate to enjoy.   Since then, families & friends from all over the world have gathered here to create their own special memories.  We hope you'll visit us, too!\n\nPoised on a graceful mountainside overlooking majestic Lake George, a castle awaits you...  ",

We loved the delightful “Kandinsky Bath” and the “Chinese Room” with it’s dragon, and the wall nook beds in the library which reflected the eclectic interests of multiple occupants. We loved the soccer field lawn and the roses. The sloping uneven spiral stairs were dangerous for some of us, especially with no loo on the main floor. The many fire doors made for an isolated feeling and it was hard to keep them closed as requested. Despite the huge dining table, people congregated in the small (modernized) kitchen which could have better seating. Anna was there with tools right away to replace a doorknob and attempt to mend the fancy built in Expresso Maker. The separate 2 bed apt was especially appealing, though less quirky than the main house.

We had a catering team come and provide dinner one evening which was very cool and worked well in the low lit, moody dining room. \nLoads of space for chill out time, Stoke up the fire and get cosy. \nOur stay was fantastic and I would highly recommend Monkton House for a cool dinner event or just a relaxed break.",

Anna got us in touch with a local taxi service that drove us around day and night all weekend (Monkton House is a 20 min drive from the city centre) and with a company that organised amazingly fun Highland games in the gardens of Monkton House. \n\nEveryone in Scotland is super friendly and always helped us with tips on restaurants and other activities. Monkton House itself is a beautiful old building with beautifully themed rooms, ranging from a cosy bar under a vaulted ceiling, to a Chinese room and a Kandinsky bathroom.\n\nI would recommend a stay at the Monkton House to anyone. Thanks Anna!",

There is something for everyone, from fine dining to traditional pub food. Ulverston is a festival town, with flags, walking, art, and music festivals in the summer and the Dickensian Christmas festival in late November. Stan Laurel was born there, and it holds the world record for the biggest foam pie fight, revealing a fun, community-minded town. The town and surrounding countryside offer beautiful views of the southern Lake District and Morecambe Bay. Deepest, widest, and shortest canal makes for a lovely afternoon walk with a pub and bay views. All National Park attractions are accessible. Derwent Beach is a popular beach for families. Nearby family attractions include the South Lakes Wild Animal Park, Lakes Windermere and Coniston, and Birkrigg Common.",

Homely and comfortable with superfast broadband throughout, experience heritage and high-tech combining in style.\n \nYour Castle\n \n“Wander lonely as a cloud” around our beautifully landscaped, fragrant grounds, sip cocktails on Pettinger’s Lawn, and dance the night away to the strains of your favourite music. Engage in a spot of croquet on the lawn or petanque on the shingle. Or catch up with a whisky around one of four open log fires set in the large ornamental stone fireplaces of the State Drawing Room, Lumley Room and Entrance Hall.\n \nIf you’re feeling competitive, enjoy a game of backgammon or draughts on our ornate fold-out board games table. Browse paintings and books that date back to the 16th century in the Bishops Library. Marvel at the mystique of our 13th century Strickland Tower with its circular stone staircase and dungeon set against magnificent views across the Caldew Valley below and the Lake District fells just to the south.\n \nOur luxurious State Drawing Room with its hand-painted chinoiserie wallpaper is the perfect space to relax as a large group of family and friends, especially at the end of an active day exploring the fells and lakes of the UNESCO World Heritage Lake District close by, visiting William Wordsworth's house, or further north, Hadrian's Wall is just 24 miles away.\n \nThis is your castle in Cumbria, a place to gather, celebrate and make memories together.\n  \nAttention to detail\n \nEach room has been designed around a unique colour palette, furnished with carefully curated antique pieces and hand-crafted upholstery in luxurious fabrics. The attention to detail is simply breath-taking.\n \n6 reception rooms\n \nThere are 6 reception rooms for you to enjoy. Gather in comfort on the plush pink velvet couches in the State Drawing Room to chat, play boardgames, or simply admire the view across the valley. Seamless SONOS room-to-room music. Our atmospheric historic chapel offers space for reflection or making music on the grand piano. Cosy up for a movie night and project your favourite film onto its large white walls!\n \n15 bedrooms\n \nEach of our 15 individually themed bedrooms have been lovingly restored to the highest standards with original fireplaces, stone windows, folding wooden shutters and exquisite cornicing.\n \nOur deluxe bathrooms, with their premium toiletries, underfloor heating and modern fixtures, make the castle a haven for those seeking an indulgent pampering retreat. Of the 15 rooms, 13 are ensuite, with two adjoining single rooms just perfect for families or carers. 12 of the 15 bedrooms can be easily set up with either a super king bed or twin beds. The Castle comfortably sleeps up to 28 guests.\n \nBakelite rotary dial telephones feature in every bedroom, and there are no distracting TVs, just fast broadband.\n \nBoardroom meeting space\n \nA large modern 65” TV, “Owl” 360 conferencing for Zoom on fast internet connections and VOIP telephone systems can be found in the Peace Study, our connected boardroom meeting space.\n \nRose Castle has the ideal space to blend business and pleasure.\n \nReception Office\n \nThis is your castle complete with a dedicated office. The grand green leather desk used by the previous Bishops who lived here is complemented by a hand-made bureau stacked with the state-of-the-art technology you’d expect. Use this private office to get work done.\n \nYour Kitchen\n \nOur fully kitted Boost Kitchen is your homely and practical space to use for the duration of your stay, whether you want to whip up a batch of sangria, cook a full English breakfast, or pop in for a fancy coffee made using the multi-choice bean coffee machine. The Boost Kitchen looks out over Pettinger’s Garden, across the Apothecary Garden, and beyond to the Lake District fells.\n \nWe have a chef within our professional team you can optionally call upon to cater a magnificent feast using the full facilities of our commercial kitchen, which itself is not available for guest cooking.\n \nBaby Changing and Accessibility\n \nBaby changing facilities, cots and high-chairs are available. There is disabled access to all ground floor and first floor main rooms of the castle, including the Chapel and State Drawing Room. Three bedrooms and the reception rooms on the first floor are all wheelchair accessible via a lift. One large bedroom on the first floor has a deluxe accessible bathroom designed to the latest building regulations, with an adjoining single bedroom which can be used by a carer or family member.\n \nWe also cater for other disabilities throughout the building, including visual fire alarms for any guests who are hard of hearing.\n \nSecluded, but just 7 miles from the M6\n \nDespite enjoying splendid seclusion, Rose Castle is just 7 miles from the M6, making it accessible from the Scottish Borders and anyone driving up north from London.\n \nLake District National Park and Hadrian’s Wall\n \nThere is plenty to see and do in and around Rose Castle. The Lake District National Park offers an impressive range of outdoor activities for walking, hiking, kayaking and mountain biking. Outdoor enthusiasts are in for a treat with no end of exhilarating hikes and picturesque trails to enjoy, including England’s highest peak, Scafell Pike.\n \nAnd there are plenty of museums, galleries, shops and eateries in nearby Keswick (22 miles), Cockermouth (23 miles) and Penrith (16 miles).\n \nIf you’re a cultural aficionado, explore Cumbria’s rich heritage at the Wordsworth Museum and Dove Cottage, and immerse yourself in the life and works of our famous poet William Wordsworth, who himself visited Rose Castle in August 1803, alongside Dorothy Wordsworth, his wife, and Samuel Coleridge, who recorded their visit starting with the phrase, “We are delighted with Rose Castle”.\n \nCarlisle, with its famed mediaeval castle and popular Tullie House Museum, is a mere 8 miles away. If you fancy a spot of retail therapy, you’ll be spoiled for choice with plenty of high-street stores and quirky local shops to potter in.\n \nRose Castle was fortified to keep the Scots out following an attack by Robert the Bruce in 1323. The towers and crenellations embedded in our walls aren’t just decoration! Hadrian’s Wall is 24 miles away and Scotland is even closer. Rose Castle is your gateway to the Scottish Borders, not just the Lake District.",

Primarily the Kerr family influence on the town. I do wish there was more information on the history there when you stay there. That way you can understand the history of the property and know when the house was built and see what/ when sections were added on to the original tower.",

    "summary": "The Lothian Wing wing was built on the original foundation stones of the 17th century Ferniehirst Castle kitchens, to serve as the private apartment of the late Lord and Lady Lothian.

    "neighborhood": "Our private riverside walk is a stone’s throw from the Castle and the perfect place to get a taste of our beautiful Borders countryside. Stroll in woodlands by the meandering Jed Water, before taking the steps up to our viewing point to take in the vista.\n\nTwo miles north of Ferniehirst is the colourful and historical town of Jedburgh. The town is dominated by the red sandstone ruins of Jedburgh Abbey (pictured above), founded in 1138 by David I. Other attractions are Mary Queen of Scots’ House, a museum that tells the story of her tragic life.",

It’s that history which is commemorated in the Common Ridings and other local festivals, creating a colourful pageant much enjoyed by visitors and native Borderers alike.",

An ideal vacation place for you, your family and friends. A place to unwind and relax whilst on your luxury Irish castle stay. Springfield is a family owned business run by Jonathan and Betty. Betty's brother Robert and his wife Rita, Lord and Lady Muskerry live in South Africa but visit at least once a year as Robert has a keen interest in his family home and its restoration. The estate includes beautiful woodlands and an organic working deer farm and Jonathan will be more than happy to take you to meet the deer. It is also a historic castle where many battles were fought and for those who are interested Betty will share her wealth of knowledge and give you a tour of the 15th Century Tower house adjacent to the East Tower .There are wonderful woodland walks, barbeque areas, and lots of lovely outdoor spaces. The East tower has open plan shared spaces with a lovely long sitting room and a very quaint pub. The castle has lovely open fires where you can sit with a drink and relax. While you can cater for yourself while staying in the Castle we can arrange a chef to come in and cater for breakfasts, lunches and dinners if required.We produce a lot of fruit and vegetables in our chemical free walled garden and this produce is available for guests to buy.If you decide to enjoy a meal while staying the chef will use as much of the fresh produce from the garden as possible. We do hold weddings and celebrations for up to 80 people at the castle and east tower but these incur an extra fee on top of the rental price.",

    "summary": "Dating back to 1698, this extraordinary castle provides an escape like no other. Enjoy 55 acres of surrounding gardens, an outdoor swimming pool and a living space that is fit for royalty.",
    "space": "Incredible riverside location on the Devon and Cornwall border\nAn impressive living space with grand décor, historic antiques, and elegant interiors\nAn outdoor, solar-heated swimming pool and 55 acres of woodland gardens to explore\n\n\nAbout the property\n\nOozing luxury, Cornish Castle is set in an idyllic location beside the River Tamar. You will be impressed by the grandeur yet feel completely at home, with two cosy living spaces, 11 individually styled bedrooms and a private garden featuring your very own solar-heated pool. Should you wish to venture beyond the castle, the city of Plymouth is just 20 minutes away or you can delve further into Cornwall to experience its many attractions and beautiful coastline.\n\nYour journey begins with the picturesque driveway, paving the way to this magnificent abode. Sir James Tillie’s statue will greet you in the Courtyard, before stepping inside to be impressed by the castle’s grandeur and many years of family history.\n\nThe elegant dining room sits in the heart of the castle and is a fabulous place to wine, dine, entertain, and socialise. Seating up to 22 guests, you can gather here for a delicious banquet, admire the gold-framed portraits and clink champagne glasses until nightfall. Once replenished, retire to the drawing room in front of the open log fire, sink into the cosy sofas and reminisce good memories under the glistening chandelier.\n\nNext door you will find the morning room, a comfortable space to relax and unwind. Nestle into the sofas, sip a warming cup of tea, and admire the far-reaching views from the patio doors. As the sun starts to set, wiggle your toes in front of the open fire or snuggle up to watch a film on the TV.\n\nThe large kitchen provides everything you should need to self-cater with ease, including an AGA, a large gas oven and hob, two dishwashers, a microwave, and an American-style fridge/freezer. Congregate around the eight-seater dining table to discuss your next adventure or natter over a cup of coffee to start the morning right. Rearing off the kitchen is a handy boot room, where you will find a selection of Le Chameau’s to wear for your walks.\n\nHead down the steps to the cellar/games room where you will find an abundance of activities to keep the whole group entertained. There is a pool table, table football, a dartboard, and a Smart TV, enabling you to watch the latest sports match or big game.\n\nThere are eleven bedrooms, all of which have been beautifully decorated with soft linen sheets, original antiques, and chic interiors throughout. There is one accessible bedroom on the ground floor, featuring a wet room and all the luxuries the first floor rooms provide. The impressive staircase will lead you to eight first-floor bedrooms, all of which boast incredible views of the river or gardens and are equipped with a king-size bed as standard and en-suites (all bar one with a shower and bath). The final two bedrooms are additional rooms in the attic, sharing a shower room with views across the gardens. The option to have rooms twinned (two single beds) is available in all rooms except the Dewhurst Suite, Coryton and Wyndham. Bayly is twinned as standard.\n\nThe outside space is complete with 55 acres of private woodland to explore, a solar-heated outdoor swimming pool and three large terraces with riverside views. Play a game of croquet on the lawn, toast marshmallows on the fire pit under a blanket of stars and absorb the exceptional surroundings that will take your breath away time and time again.",

    "neighborhood": "Cornish Castle is located a short drive from Saltash, also known as the ‘Gateway to Cornwall’ and neighbours the famous St Mellion Golf Course. Whilst there is so much to do nearby, the estate itself provides an abundance of activities to enjoy, including walking the woodland gardens, stand up paddleboarding on the River Tamar, gin tasting, clay pigeon shooting (available between April and June), 4x4 driving and so much more.\n\nJust 10 minutes away, ‘The Who’d Have Thought It Inn’ serves delicious home-cooked meals and provides a hearty Cornish pub atmosphere. The local town of Saltash features all the amenities you will need for your self-catering stay and the many close-by villages and towns allow you to browse boutiques, grab a coffee and a slice of cake or enjoy a locally sourced meal in a restaurant beside the sea.\n\nThere are several beautiful beaches located across the coastline. Whitsand Bay is a short 30-minute drive, with the popular surfing spots of Newquay and Polzeath reachable within an hour. Enjoy a scenic stroll, a spot of paddleboarding or coasteering if you are feeling adventurous.\nIf the weather is not on your side, fear not. Visit the world-renowned Eden Project in St Austell and discover its two huge domes of tropical and Mediterranean plant life, or venture into nearby Plymouth to explore The National Marine Aquarium.",

It was a shame that the restaurant was closed, we’d love to enjoy a dinner in the beautiful outdoor bubbles.

Hospitality was wonderful and it was idyllic to sit and drink tea in the beautiful living room looking out onto the views of the mountains and the water. We brought our dog Ellie who was also made very welcome, and it was ideal to be able to walk straight out onto the beach from the house.\nFood was excellent - dessert of a chocolate brownie with a salted caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream was without doubt one of the best we’d ever had! \nWe had the floral suite which was beautiful, the only downside was that it would be nice to have a shower rather than just a bath, but the fact that the sauna area was just down the corridor from the room meant that this wasn’t a big issue.\nThis would be a great house to rent out for a birthday or celebration weekend. Many thanks for such a wonderful end to our trip to Scotland!",

This was clear throughout the whole property. \n\nAs we stepped through and got the wee tour, we saw how magical this place is. Staying originally only one day in the floral suite we felt like we were living in a fairytale. We loved it so much we booked another night in the Emperor Suite. The rolls were big and had everything you could ever want. \n\nEla and her staff were simply so lovely and genuine. Caring and attention to detail was incredible. I was shocked at how attentive they were. They genuinely cared about your happiness while you’re there. \n\nFrom sitting out watching the sea waves splash against the outer wall during the day and seeing the beautiful mountains as a backdrop to late at night relaxing into the furniture outside under the stars and watching the moon. This places is just such a romantic retreat and I hope and pray it is not the last time I’m in the area.\n\nYou will come away from this place sad, sad you couldn’t stay longer but my goodness will you have memories and stories to tell.\n\nThanks again Ela and team. It’s not good bye 👋🏻",

    "summary": "Luxury room in a magical setting with panoramic views of Glencoe, Mull and Loch Linnhe",
    "space": "An impeccably restored Scottish Baronial Manor nestled between the great Ben Nevis and Loch Linnhe affording sweeping views from Glencoe all the way to Isle of Mull and across to Ardnamurchan peninsula.\nThis unique residence has a special place in the local history so I hope you'll enjoy your time at this  19th century baronial retreat built in the same architectural style as Her Majesty The Queen's favourite retreat at Balmoral Castle.\nRedesigned now to accommodate a large family group with all the amenities of a luxury hotel and the comfort of a grand country residence most of the original features have been preserved and stunning new ones have been installed to create lavish marble ensuites with heated floors and new bedrooms out of thin air. Stone cast bathtubs, bronze sinks and sculpted marble pedestals complement exquisite art deco Imperial sanitary and custom made bathroom fittings. The Floral Suite has a spectacular marble ensuite with bathtub  and sweeping view towards the loch and Glencoe. The property enjoys a great deal of privacy from its commanding position on the tip of the headland sat amidst 3 acres of landscaped grounds with its own sunny beach and accessed via private road. You will have privacy as the house is flanked by the sea and by its woodland and with very few neighbours around it truly is a retreat into nature.\nThe room is fitted with USB sockets, sound speakers, electric blankets and luxurious bedding and towels. You will have a large down filled duvets and different types of pillows to choose from (down & feather, hollow fibre or water pillows).",
    "access": "During your stay you will have access to the entire ground floor (morning room, dining area, conservatory).\nThe lounge area in the morning room is the perfect spot to relax or snooze. Large wood-burning fireplaces, make the house truly magical in the wintertime when a giant Christmas tree takes residence. And as much as the Highlands are famous for the magnificent outdoors there is also a time to cosy up in front of a log fire in the TV room.\nThe house is dog friendly and there is a midweek housekeeping service included free of charge for longer stays. \nContinental Breakfast consists of a selection of local produce and homemade treats and preserves to enjoy. Leisure activities can be arranged on site at affordable costs (yoga, fitness, bootcamp, mountain hikes, massages or hairdressing services). Be prepared to be pampered and looked after in our spa or blissfully left to your own devices to enjoy your stay without any interference. But whichever it is, lace up those boots and get walking at least once whilst you’re here! Be it for an epic hike to the summit of Ben Nevis (the highest mountain in the British Isles) or just a stroll into the wilderness nearby (you can walk to the Corran ferry from the house or cross by car and within minutes Ardnamurchan opens up a whole box of surprises for the keen or casual walker). There’s something for everyone and rest assure there’s nothing better than a long soak in the bathtub afterwards or a steaming hot powershower followed by stiff drink in the conservatory. Here you can unwind before dinner watching the sun set on Glencoe and Mull and as serene sunsets compete with thundering storms for your full attention you can probably point by then the peaks you’ve claimed on Ardnamurchan!.\n\nA good steady internet connection throughout the house and nearby so you can be as connected as you wish to be. The house has CCTV in some public areas connected to the security system with Police response.",
    "notes": "Fort William is a very short drive away (15 min) for all major supermarkets Marks &Spencer, Morrissons, Aldi & Lidl or 7 min to Co-op in the village towards Glencoe where you can also find a Post Office where you can exchange currency or use the ATM machine.",
    "transit": "there is a bus stop at the end of the road with frequent service to Fort William.",

Everything was so clean, and the amount of space is unbelievably large.  I can't tell you how pleased my family was with this experience.  The three bedrooms collectively have 5 separate beds (all King or Queen size, I believe) and each bedroom has its own bathroom.  The kitchen is large with plenty of appliances.  The sitting room is gigantic with several couches and chairs.  The views are astonishing, and it is super quiet in the entire apartment.  I rarely write reviews, but our experience was so positive that I wanted to share these thoughts.",

Whatever you decide, it’s a good idea to put your requirements at the forefront when discussing with our travel experts who are the best in the business and we have countless awards to match. Trust us, we'll find you the perfect villa holiday to surpass your expectations. \n\nAnd the best part? Once you book a villa holiday, the service doesn't stop there.

    "neighborhood": "Ulverston is a quaint, historic market town with a cobblestone main street. It has a wide variety of locally owned stores, cafes, and pubs serving up hearty fare and cold ones alike. There is a wide variety of restaurants serving everything from gourmet cuisine to classic pub fare. Throughout the summer, Ulverston hosts a variety of festivals, from a flag-raising and walking festival to an art and music festival, and in late November, the town hosts the world-famous Dickensian Christmas festival. In addition to being the place where Stan Laurel was born, it also holds the record for the largest foam pie fight in the world. There are wonderful walks in the countryside around the town, with sights such as Morecambe Bay and the southern Lake District. The deepest, widest, and shortest canal in the world can be found here, and it makes for a lovely afternoon stroll with a pub and bay views at its conclusion. Access to the park's many sights is a breeze. The sandy beaches and excellent birdwatching along the Furness Coast are a major draw. Popular Birkrigg Common, with its breath-taking vistas of Morecambe Bay, is also close by, as is the South Lakes Wild Animal Park and Lakes Windermere and Coniston.",

We were thrilled to have the opportunity to stay there and would absolutely recommend it to anyone looking for a unique experience for a weekend. The host seemed very on top of everything. Keep in mind that she is a more hands on Airbnb host than we are used to. We typically prefer to be left alone to enjoy a space, while she seemed to prefer to give instructions in person and throughout our stay, even to the point of telling us how to care for our children and entering the apartment without warning during our stay. As airbnb guests we are used to following clear written instructions and responsibly caring for a space as requested. She easily could have posted instructions for the various things she asked of us throughout our stay and then let us be, and that would have felt much less stressful.",

    "space": "The adventure begins as you enter my front door with a winding stone spiral staircase leading upto The Bridge House.\n\nThe top of the stairs opens into the conservatory dining room.\n\nFrom here you can access the little bedroom and kitchen/sittingroom.\n\nThe little bedroom has a small double bed, great views upriver and a quirky privy from olden days!\n\nThe kitchen sitting room is surrounded by traditional scottish timber clad walls and floor. It has a cosy log burning stove and pretty views downriver. The kitchen is fully fitted with everything you need.\n\nFrom the kitchen sittingroom you access the romantic master bedroom with kingsize 4 poster, smart TV, ornamental fireplace and fitted mini wardrobes. I hope you'll sleep as well as I do with the peaceful sound of the river below.\n\nThe bathroom has a choice of shower or bath. \n\nThere are stone walkways all around The  Bridge House with magical views down to the river below. They connect with the veranda seating area nestled in the castellations and a small sauna in a mini stone 'outbuilding'.",
    "access": "Garden up river is shared with the stable apartment.",
    "notes": "There is another completely separate 2 bedroom apartment in the stables just over the bridge. It is completely detached apart from a stone walkway which is only used if the two units are rented as one (4 bedroom).\n\nDue to the upper walkway walls being only 1 meter high in places we do recommend bringing children unless the are kept an eye on at all times.\n\nThe little bedroom has a small double bed (120cm wide). Comfy and cosy but can be tight for two.\n\nThere is a charge per pet per booking (not always pets accepted or any pets accepted)",
    "neighborhood": ". Peaceful and rural. Listen to the river below and sheep in the distance.\n. Great walking all around. Cateran Trail is just 5 minutes up the road.\n. Traditional pubs in Bridge of Cally and Kirkmichael with good food. (5 minutes by car.)\n. Tourist hotspots of Braemar, Pitlochry, Dunkeld and Perth all within an hours drive.\n. Glenshee skiing 35 minutes.",

Ulverston is a festival town, with flags, walking, art, and music festivals in the summer and the Dickensian Christmas festival in late November. Stan Laurel was born there, and it holds the world record for the biggest foam pie battle, revealing a joyful, community-minded town. The town and surrounding area offer stunning views of the southern Lake District and Morecambe Bay. Deepest, widest, and shortest canal makes for a great afternoon walk with a pub and bay views.",

Make no mistake, this place is not a comfortable accommodation, it is an experience, so you need to show up with this expectation.  We came after visiting Ashford Castle, which is a 5-star luxury resort, so it was a bit of a shock initially.  But it was awesome, and our family of 5 (3 boys) had a blast over a 2 night stay.  You have to walk up 50 stairs up a very cool narrow spiral staircase to the living quarters and then another 15 or so to get to the bedrooms.   The restroom is in the living quarters so something to think about if you tend to get up in the middle of the night to use the restroom.  While the castle is awesome in itself, having Pete onsite made the experience equally unique.  Forget the Dos Equis guy, Pete is \"the most interesting man in the world.\" His passion for the property and story-telling certainly rounded out the experience.",

    "summary": "Cahercastle has been standing since the late 1400s One needs to be somewhat crazy to be owned by a castle , itsowned me now for 20 years, anyway it is our home its not perfect, so don't expect perfection ,we do have cobwebs and a little dust (so asthma sufferers take note)We endeavour to make your stay as comfortable as possible \nPlease note when making a request to stay please take time to write an introductory message or have an informative profile We look forward to welcoming you \nPeter / Eva",
    "space": "A beautiful, original medieval castle experience can be yours for a weekend, a week, or even longer. You'll be staying in the master bedroom, the highest room in the castle.\n\nThis castle has been restored to its original state by using traditional materials, and also by using cutting edge technology. We used traditional local stone, limestone, as well as oak beams, to make the castle as traditional as possible, but it also has modern conveniences, such as solar water heating. The castle was built sometime in the 1400's but was refurbished in the last decade. It is comprised of a master bedroom upstairs, with access to the turret, a living room and dining room, two guest bedrooms, and some storage rooms. I'm Peter, your host, and I spent the last ten years refining and refurbishing the castle - the pictures can attest to how well that has worked out. Two room in the castle are still under construction - the storage room downstairs.\n\nRemember, this is a castle that is over 600 years old. That means it's not perfect. Castles were never designed with bathrooms and showers, so we've improvised. You'll have to come downstairs to have a bath which is located in the living room - this is the quirkiest part of the castle. You have full private access to the living room,kitchen , bath and  your master bedroom  \n\nCastles are built with solid stone,  so there is a huge fireplace with a cooker to keep the place warm and of course underfloor heating complements of our pet Dragon that lives in the dungeon \n\nThe castle has lots of quirks, its a great and fun place to stay the night.\n\nGalway City is a 25 minute drive from the castle which is a very beautiful city. The castle is around a 20 minute drive from Galway Airport, a 45 minute drive from Shannon Airport and Dublin is two hours away.\n\nWhat to expect: lots of winding staircases, a castle that has been lovingly restored, but there are some cobwebs, and it gives you the real Irish castle experience. It's not pristine, its not perfect, but it's a real castle. There are lots of sheep and cows in the nearby fields - but lots of peace and quiet.\n\nThis is a very unique place to stay. There's nothing like it around, where you can say that you stayed in an actual castle. It's not a tourist attraction (like Blarney Castle) and it's not pristine like a hotel, but you'll have a great time visiting. \n\nYou'll need a car. The castle is about two miles from the nearest public transport. (Craughwell has both train and buses running regular schedules)\n\nI can help with anything like lighting a fire or answering any of your questions.\nP.S. as this is our home we like to get an idea of who's coming to stay so please write a message of introduction or have a written profile as we do sometimes decline if we just see a one liner and nothing on a profile \nso to avoid disappointment fill out your profile",
    "access": "full sole use of the top two floors ,50.spiral steps to the livingroom from the ground floor.\n15 spiral steps from the bedroom to the livingroom,,the bedroom has two double beds one being in the mezzanine ,the living room,which.is the floor below the bedroom includes the  kitchen, bath , and toilet also a very comfortable couch that can be used as a 1 person bed the access to the parapet is at the very to of the stairs",
    "notes": "Now we do have wifi but its limited so no downloading please\nAs we dont really want to have to put up our prices due to selfish use\nSignal can be quite strong so not bad for streaming",
    "neighborhood": "Countryside, farms, cows ,sheep , 3 acre garden, stream , river , trees,\nAnd you might see the odd fox, heron, pheasant, rabbit and of course the friendly farmers and neighbours\ncctv in operation outside the castle",
    "transit": "Buses or train from Galway to Craughwell just let us know how ye will be arriving and at what time your bus or train is arriving in Craughwell and we can arrange to collect you from Craughwell and bring you to the castle",
    "interaction": "We like to be here to welcome guests \nSo on or before the day you arrive if you could give us an idea of around what time you are expecting to arrive, so we can organise our day accordingly and be here to welcome you",
    "house_rules": "Please note that we we like to receive a message along with your request to stay, the castle is not a hotel but our home , so a little introduction is nice ,,,,,    Please respect the castle. It's a national monument so we can't have anyone taking artifacts. Also, please try to leave your bedroom before 1pm. We'll take care of the rest. Now this is not a hotel or a prison and we do have cobwebs and a little dust so if you are expecting a  pristine  five star hotel then go to one ,  This is our family home, so please be respectful of that, but apart from that I think you'll have an amazing experience here.\nWe like to make guests aware coming with young children that the castle is not a child friendly place ie \nUnforgiving spiral stone stairs, unprotected hot stoves , no child locks on doors and numerous other hazards inside and out for the very young \nNow if you feel that you can enjoy your stay without being stressed worrying about your children then why not\nAlso five people can be accommodated but its on the couch for one person",

Our family spent time exploring the castle and sitting by the fire, it was exactly what we were hoping for on our visit to Scotland. Just magical. \n\nChef Marco made us a private meal, it was some of the best food we’ve had on the trip, and he cleans up! Just ask the hosts for his contact information.\n\nA perfect venue to a relaxing family get away or an event, it was so picturesque and quirky.",

It was the ideal venue for our family reunion as we came together from around the world (USA, Austria, Singapore, Ireland) to attend our Scottish nephew’s wedding in nearby Dumfries. It provided an added sense of occasion to the whole experience which we will all remember for the rest of our lives.",

Despite being an ancient building, Spedlins is cosy and warm, with the option to have a roaring fire in the Great Hall! I5666666665t's also full of fascinating artwork and antiques, so there's a feast for the eyes in every room. Each corner of the castle is unique, making it 95the most incredible setting for a photo shoot.\n\nThe hosts are super friendly, accommodating and very responsive. They were also extremely understanding when we accidentally broke some plates and an ornament in the kids' room.\n\nThe castle is an absolute steal for the price and is exactly as stated in the description. The hosts aren't kidding when they say the spiral stairs are a challenge --  kiddies, or anyone with mobility issues, please heed their warnings!\n\nA wonderful stay we will remember forever.",

    "summary": "Spedlins Castle is the perfect place to rent for family/friends to meet for a holiday or celebration. The Great Hall, with its roaring fire, provides an amazing entertaining space. There's a large kitchen, a dining room with seating for 14. On the floor above are 4 bedrooms - 3 doubles, 1 twin and a bathroom. On the 4th floor is another double bedroom, plus a dormitory room with 4 single beds and a 3rd bathroom. The grounds extend to 4 acres and include beautiful gardens and a lake.",
    "space": "Entering Spedlins Castle through the original oak front door, the mediaeval quirks of the architecture are immediately apparent as you ascend the spiral stone staircase. \n\nA magical tower, rising some 48ft above the Dumfries and Galloway countryside, this unique home is just as incredible inside as it looks. Its 9ft thick stone walls have stood the test of time since 1450. Packed with history and centuries of stories, this home is an absolute gem by the banks of the River Annan. Exploring the castle for the first time is a wonderful experience, with a wealth of turrets, nooks and staircases to discover. The showstopper here is the Great Hall, with a high, arching ceiling and a Renaissance fireplace so huge you can walk inside it. Like the rest of the castle, it's dressed with antique furniture and eclectic art collected over many years by the owners. Two long sofas make for a fabulous space to relax with family and friends and, in the evening, you can light the fire and play music. Elsewhere there's a fine library, a basement playroom with Sky TV and a large kitchen with its own casual dining space and a fireplace. Formal dinners can be held in the dining room – and perhaps if you don't feel like cooking, you could ask the host to arrange a private chef. On the top floors, bedrooms are romantic and impressive. There's a beautiful four-poster in one room, a large antique French bed in the room next door, and a bed built into a cosy alcove in another. Outside there are four acres to explore, including a lake, a medieval-style topiary garden and a terrace for sipping drinks together on a summer evening. Perfect for a large group celebrating something special, this is an enchanting and memorable place to stay, just a short drive from the town of Lockerbie. And did we mention there's a famous ghost story here? Old ‘Dunty’ Porteous hasn't bothered visitors for decades but it makes for a fun tale.\n\nSpedlins is situated right next to the River Annan where you can sit and picnic on the river bank in the summer months, and where wild swimming is possible. The Annan is filled with trout and salmon and it's a great spot for fishing. There are some beautiful walks directly from the front door.\n\nThe nearest town is Lockerbie, which has a supermarket, an incredible butcher, and a selection of trains that go directly to London Euston (3 hours 40 mins). You can also get the train from Lockerbie to Glasgow, which has the nearest airport. If you're driving, Glasgow airport is about a 1 hour 10 min drive or Edinburgh airport is a 1 hour 30 min drive. Tesco and Morrison’s both deliver online shops directly to the front door. \n\nIt’s a very tranquil spot, full of history. There are plenty of things to do nearby - whether it's whisky tasting,  fishing, clay pigeon shooting or golf that you're into. \n\nOur housekeeper and gardener are always on hand in case you need them. We have a private chef who can cook you a celebratory meal or organise your food for the weekend. As well as this, we have a fantastic masseuse who lives locally. She's very happy to come to the castle to give massages. We can also arrange a guided history tour of the castle. Just let us know if you're interested in any of these services when you book so we can get things organised in advance.",
    "access": "The whole of the space is available for use by guests. on a self catering basis. We provide all your bed linen and towels. We can also offer you a private chef during your stay if required. There are two large car parks with plenty of parking space.",
    "notes": "The tower rises to 48 feet and is four stories high. You reach the top floors by a spiral stone flight of stairs so it is not suitable for the very elderly, and for safety, children and adults need to be directed to hold onto the rope which runs all along the stone spiral staircase.",
    "neighborhood": "Spedlins Castle is the perfect escape from the stresses of modern life.\nFew can remain unmoved by the unspoilt beauty of this corner of Scotland. There is so much nature to watch in the gardens, there are bird tables everywhere, attracting robins, chaffinches and swallows, and even the occasional red squirrel. There are plenty of walks directly from the front door - including along the Annandale Way which is a 5 minute walk from the castle entrance. There's whisky tasting at the nearby Annandale Distillery, several golf courses nearby, a clay pigeon shoot on the doorstep, fishing on the River Annan, or you can simply snuggle up in front of a huge open fire in the Great Hall and enjoy the utter relaxation that being away from it all brings.",
    "transit": "There is plenty of space for car parking. The nearest station is Lockerbie (5 miles/ten minute drive). Glasgow airport is a 1 hour 10 minute drive. Edinburgh airport is a 1 hour 25 minute drive.",
    "interaction": "We are are available to answer any questions by phone, text or email 24 hours a day.",
    "house_rules": "Please be aware this is a 15th century castle and there is a stone spiral staircase case that leads up to the upper floors. For safety we ask all our guests to make sure they take the stairs carefully and hold on to the rope bannister at all times.\n\nThere is a giant fire place in the Great Hall. Please be careful when using the fire and put the fire guard in front of it before going to bed.\n\nPlease note the heating is on a timer. If you would like a fire, we have fire wood available for you to use in the turret on your left as you look out of the castle entrance.",

It was centrally located for all the area places we wanted to visit- Elephant Rock, Caledonia, Johnson Shut-ins and Thee Abbey. It was a short distance from downtown- filled with cute shops (coffee, antiques, hand-made soaps, food and history). We had read there is a Friday night “pickin on the square” which is super close, however it was cancelled due to the heat advisory. Our family recommends this place for your family- everyone young and old enjoyed the stay! Host Joan was a great from beginning to end!",

My daughter loved having the huge Bull bedroom to herself overlooking the deer park, and my husband and I enjoyed the Richmond bedroom. The kitchen has everything you need to cook- and the grocery store in Brechin is just a short 10 minute drive away. There is no lift, so be prepared to carry your suitcases up a few flights. The grounds are stunning. So many paths to take and little surprises to discover. Brechin seemed like a cute village to explore, and there are other destinations within easy driving distance, but, honestly, you aren't going to want to leave Kinnaird. We felt like royalty staying there- I can't recommend this place enough.",

Throughout the initial tour, we were laughing and enjoying the small and subtle details and small surprises that awaited us here. The game room offered a variety of games that we could use and enjoy. We were tailored to a variety of things we could do here both inside and out, which after several days we did accomplish to do all of them! The attention to detail was wonderful, with the fairy tale book of knowledge to the assortment of things we can do here. The serenity of the pond was probably the best part of the trip as we definitely made use of both the boats and fishing gear here... we hit double digits in fish caught! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would welcome a chance to come back here again for another bachelor party if the situation arises to the occasion. \nThank you for everything!",

We felt very comfortable with the high-end modern amenities, yet we also felt as though we were living in history at the same time. The views are breathtaking. Imagine a professional photography book with beautiful rolling  Irish countryside images. THAT is what you see from the property. We spent quite a bit of time sitting outside gazing at the gorgeous landscape. Star gazing at midnight was better than anywhere we have seen. The host, John, was extremely responsive to all of my inquiries. He was very helpful and friendly. We highly recommend staying at this amazing castle!",

  "description": {
    "summary": "Tubbrid Castle is a unique 15th-century tower house, uninhabited for the last century and now restored to its former glory. We've highlighted original features to let you step back in time and added luxury touches so you can indulge your inner prince or princess.",
    "space": "Heritage\nIn 942 AD, Muircheartach, King of modern-day Ulster, marched his army of 1000 Leather Cloaks south to avenge his allies, who had been attacked by Callaghan, King of Cashel. Muircheartach’s bard, Colmanach, recorded the journey in an epic poem, Circuit of Ireland, in which he praised the beauty of Osraí (now Kilkenny), and the hospitality of its people. At the edge of enemy territory and on the cusp of battle, Muircheartach’s army set up camp in Tubbrid, on a plain that a millennium later is still called Bán an Champa (the Field of the Encampment). The King himself is thought to have slept at the fort where Tubbrid Castle now stands. A thousand years later, the people of Kilkenny still pride ourselves on our warm hospitality and from the top floor bedroom of Tubbrid Castle you can survey Bán an Champa and enjoy lodgings befitting a king.\n\n\nLuxury \nStaying in our authentic Irish tower house doesn’t mean foregoing the finer things in life. Start your day under a powerful rainforest shower or in a deep, bubbly bath. Sip your morning coffee while taking in vistas of forest and field from bespoke velvet cushions in the large original window seats. In the evening you can dine at the grand oak banqueting table before curling up with a book or a board game in front of a roaring log fire. However you choose to spend your day, you can look forward to coming home to spend the night under a goose down duvet in a superking four-poster bed.\n\n\nLocation\nSituated just 20 minutes from Kilkenny City and deep in the heart of Ireland's Ancient East, it’s the perfect location from which to explore the most beautiful parts of our vibrant country. Picturesque rural Kilkenny is home to hiking trails of all levels. In Kilkenny City, just a twenty-minute drive away, you can while away a leisurely day exploring its secret cobblestone laneways, impressive cathedrals and magnificent castle, before treating yourself to a pint of the local brew, Smithwicks, or to Michelin-starred cuisine. In an afternoon you can cycle along the banks of the Nore as it meanders through South Kilkenny, to quaint and scenic villages like Inistioge, or visit the workshops of Ireland's foremost craftspeople. If you want to visit a wide array of Ireland’s attractions without the hassle of packing and unpacking your suitcase every second night, Tubbrid Castle is the ideal base. Whichever direction you face, the rich diversity of Irish history and nature is on your doorstep. Dublin is just a ninety-minute drive away. You can take in the Rock of Cashel (30 mins), Kinsale and Cork City (90 mins) in one day, Limerick (90 mins), the Burren and the Cliffs of Moher (2h15) another, and Galway (2h15) and Connemara another.",
    "access": "We only take one booking at a time, so you will have the castle to yourselves.\n\nEach bedroom is named for a different important character in the castle's history.\n\nSeomra Sheáin, on the ground floor, is named for my late father, John, who began the restoration work in 2004.\n\nRí Ailig, on the second floor, is named after Muirchertach, King of Ulster, whose army camped in Tubbrid in 942 AD on their Circuit of Ireland.\n\nLeapa Mhaighread is named for Margaret Butler, 8th Countess of Ormonde. She is said to have erected the tower house and legend holds that she slept at its highest point when she was in residence, to keep her safe from invading enemies. As this bedroom is on a closed timber mezzanine above Rí Ailig, the two rooms are not acoustically private from each other.",
    "notes": "Tubbrid Castle is a living, 600-year-old piece of Irish heritage, but it is not a five-star hotel. Central heating was recently turned on in the tower house for the first time in its long life. Over coming years, as the walls cure, they are expected to undergo changes in moisture, which will create alterations in colour and a little dust and condensation.",
    "neighborhood": "The castle shares an entrance laneway with another house, which is not shown in the photos, to protect our neighbours' privacy.",
    "transit": "The nearest train station is Kilkenny City and it is possible to get a taxi from there to Tubbrid Castle.",
    "interaction": "A member of my family or I will be contactable should you need anything during your stay.",
    "house_rules": "The castle is unsuitable for parties, including hen and stag parties.",

They both have the same ambiance and character of a European winery - lovely and spacious! Great central location to the mountains, SLC and Provo while being very private.\n\nTanner and Nicole were such accommodating hosts!  I appreciated the way they helped me move from one unit to the other.  We all appreciated the time Tanner took to give us a tour around the grounds and buildings that are used for weddings and events. So much family history and we enjoyed hearing of all the reclaimed wood, ironwork, etc that were used!\n\nThe rooms were all decorated simply and elegantly. The dining room was sunny, cheerful and bright with a balcony overlooking the orchard. The kitchen had everything needed. The pictures online are exactly what you see in person.   \n\nLoved my home away from home!",

We had the pleasure meeting the owner and his sister who told us the history of the farm and gave us a tour of the castle and the grounds. We would love to return in a season other than winter to appreciate the orchards and gardens. This place is wonderful and there is not enough words to describe. Most of all, as a family, we made great memories spending time together in this fabulous place. Thanks!!",

Easy check in. Secluded from the public but not from nature ! Nature is all around you. And the windows and balcony’s allowed you to really immerse in the views! Mountain View’s and sunsets. And the babydoll sheep’s were adorable. The orchards, even covered in snow were picture perfect. Everything was a short drive away! I celebrated my one year anniversary and was happy to hear many weddings happen at Wadley farm. Alan Wadley gave us a personal tour of the grounds and told us about the history and future of the Farm! Thoroughly enjoyed his excitement. Highly recommend this is a hidden gem! By far one of my favorite air bnb! Will be returning in fall<3",

Brandon was also great at communicating instructions and expectations, was always quick to respond and very friendly. The road to get to the castle was a little intimidating but it was well worth the drive and once you drive it a few times you get the hang of it. I will definitely rent this place again the next time I’m in the area. Overall, I can’t say enough good stuff about this place!",

The Host went above and beyond to have this place ready for us when we arrived in the night. The turrets were lit up and it seemed as if we really were walking into a Castle. The interior of the residence, gave us the log cabin, midevil experience. Decor was superb. The location of the property was spectactular as we have stayed in this area several times over the years. No harsh Mountain Roads to drive up and down. Which was a major plus in the safety category for us!!! The enviroment around the AirBnB was peaceful and calming. No noise from neighbors or traffic. Which allowed us to spend the perfect weekend to celebrate our Anniversary. The Residence itself was super clean, plenty of towels, linens and toiletries. The beds were cozy and comfortable. The host had plenty of cooking supplies, utensils and anything else we needed to make our stay, One to Remember.",

We’re a dungeons and dragons group, so needless to say we LOVED the details put into this space — swords, shields, and beautiful stone spiral staircases. It felt like our own magical fortress. The area is pretty remote so the wifi wasn’t always reliable, but Brandon gave us a heads up beforehand and people were able to hotspot with their phones to get work done. We appreciated the list of nearby attractions (split rail is a hidden GEM), and had some wonderful dinners on the gorgeous porch. Thank you Brandon!",

With 4 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms and a fully stocked kitchen it was perfect for a large family or multiple couples. Close to attractions such as Cliffs of Moher, Galway, Shannon, The Burren and Doolin (for ferry to Aran Islands).  Need to be extra careful on the stone spiral stairs and the long climb to top bedroom and bathroom. But if you take it slow you will be fine!  I can’t recommend the castle enough to anyone visiting this part of Ireland.",

The Irish countryside is so beautiful in its own way and to be able to stay in such a fun place made the trip that much better. I will highly recommend that you ensure anyone in your party can climb sketchy stairs. Worst part was lugging the luggage up to the rooms, my favorite part was finding 4 leaf clovers right outside the door! Since it is in the countryside and inside a block wall the cell/internet service doesn’t work great, but that made for a nice getaway as well. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone interested. Come on, it’s a castle and you get to be king and/or queen for as long as your stay! Make sure to have a fire and enjoy!",

    "summary": "Located only 10 minutes from the West coast of Ireland in the beautiful County Clare, Smithstown Castle is the perfect place to start your Irish adventure. Experience a true 15th Century Irish Castle, authentic in style yet with all the comfort of the 21st Century.\nSet rurally on almost 5 acres of mature grounds overlooking a river valley, the Castle offers tranquility and privacy - and yet Clare is at your doorstep, with all its bountiful attractions, epic landscapes and stunning history.",
    "space": "The Castle is an original 15th Century building. This means it has the following features which must be taken into consideration before booking:\n\n- thick walls (up to a meter thick), so reception is limited to a few corners!\n- the spiral staircase means the Castle is unfortunately unsuitable for wheelchair users. Please be extremely careful using the stairs! Avoid drinking too much alcohol for your own safety, always supervise infants/children, and always hold on to the handrails/rope. Especially if the stones get wet, they can become slippy and very dangerous!\n- Due to the nature of the stone walls, if the weather is very wet and rainy over a prolonged period, it can occur that water pushes through the walls and emerges from some alcoves/window-niches in small amounts. This shouldn't affect your stay, but it is something we'd like you to be aware of so there are no strange surprises. \n- Please bring your slippers! :)",
    "access": "Sufficient space for parking in the direct proximity of the Castle. \n\nOur caretakers will be there to welcome you in, show you around, and hand over the keys. They can also give you some great tips on nearby shopping facilities, live music and dance, where to eat and drink and all sorts of things to do, see and experience in the area.You can also contact them if you have any questions or problems during your stay.",
    "notes": "We also offer 1-night stays, the booking procedure can only proceed with us privately, however (not over the AirBnB platform due to certain restrictions). Please get in touch with us via email (email-address can be found on our website) for a quote and more infos. \n\nIf you want to dive a little deeper into Smithstown Castle's fascinating history, or discover what's to do and see in the area, please visit our website: smithstowncastle(dot)com. \n\nSome of the most important attractions nearby include:\n\nThe famous Cliffs of Moher (15min drive): Rising 509 feet (155m) and extending over 9 miles (15km) along the West Atlantic coast. The breathtaking scenery here was even featured in the movie 'Harry Potter'. \nOur caretaker offers discounted hiking tours at the cliffs!\n\nDoolin (10min drive): this coastal town is the mecca for Irish music and dance, pubs and celtic craft. At Doolin's pier you will find ferries heading to the Aran Islands. \n\nAran Islands: Horse-drawn carriages, minibus tours and bicycles for hire await you at the bustling pier of Inish Mor, the largest of the 3 Islands. The nearby Heritage Centre will tell of a rugged traditional way of life that is fast disappearing. \n\nKilfenora (5min drive): The smallest diocesan of Ireland with it's ancient cathedral and famous high-crosses. Learn about the stunning Burren in the 'Burren Exhibition Centre'. Visit Vaughan's for food, drink and regular live Irish music and dance!\n\nThe Burren: This limestone plateau is a spectacular landscape carved by glaciers, wind and rain.

The only single small negative about the place is that checkin is quite late in the day and checkout quite early, but other than that it was all brilliant. The surroundings were amazing, our kids will have treasured memories forever. Contact with the hosts and the checkin process was seamless and very clear, they were so helpful for us. The castle was so much fun for us and our kids. Can't recommend this Castle enough.",

        "comments": "Our stay at the castle was remarkable. Situated on a gentle slope leading down to the waters of Lough Corrib, Carraigan Castle sparks the imagination and evokes the mystical feelings of days gone by, of Christmas, of magic, of gold at the end of a rainbow. It impressed the most stoic of our group. Young and old, we all felt the specialness of this amazing home and grounds.\nWe rented the boat- so much fun! It’s a small outboard so it’s not for the faint of heart but going out on this beautiful lake was a life changing experience.\nWe highly recommend having beautiful Tina make you a feast for dinner- seemed to be a little expensive at first but was worth every penny and we had wholesome food that lasted are entire stay, 3 nights. \nWe had tea at Ashford Castle while we were there, reservations needed and expensive but worth it, another remarkable place just 20 minutes from Carraigan. I highly recommend a visit there during your stay or at least to the little town of Cong that it’s in.",

    "summary": "13th Century Lakeside Castle, 6 Bedrooms, 2 Baths, (Sleeps 10-12)\n\nSurrounded by seven acres of lawns, park and woodland, Carraigin Castle is an idyllic holiday home in a beautiful setting on the shores of Lough Corrib. From the Castle one can enjoy boating and fishing, walking, riding and sightseeing, or just relax by the open hearth and contemplate the simple grandeur of this ancient dwelling, a rare and beautiful example of a fortified, medieval “hall house”.",
    "space": "You will love the relaxed atmosphere of this authentic 13th-century manor house, which has been restored by the present owner after more than two centuries as a roofless ruin.  Carraigin's church-like structure sits on a rise reached by an avenue across the tree-lined Pleasure Ground.  The ancient-looking, nail-studded front door on the ground floor, often mistaken for an authentic antiquity, was actually made by the owner during the building's restoration in the 1970s.  Round the corner, an imposing stone staircase leads to another grand entrance, into the lofty, oak-beamed Great Hall featuring a wide, stone-arched fireplace that provides a comforting aroma of turf and wood-smoke.\nThe Great Hall is the central living and dining area of the castle. It features a mix of old oak and comfortable modern furniture surrounding the welcoming hearth. Its white walls are extensively decorated with tapestries, brass rubbing portraits of ancient kings and knights and a magnificent triptych featuring a Galway galleon. There is a tiny but well-equipped kitchen next door. \nOn the same level as the Hall is an oak-beamed double bedroom with a king-size bed and bathroom.  A stone staircase winds upwards over this master bedroom to a gallery room overlooking the Great Hall. Another winding stairs leads up to a little single bedroom in the corner tower (available only in the summer).  From both of these second-floor rooms you can stroll out onto the castle parapets with fabulous views of Lough Corrib and the hills of Connemara and Mayo.\nThe rest of you sleep in the four cosy 'Vaults' on the ground floor below The Vaults have much picturesque charm with their oak-timbered partitions, arches and vaulted ceilings, and they work if you know each other well as the rooms lead one into the other. Vault I, the largest of the four, sleeps two in bunk-beds and features a fair-sized work table and chairs for busy teenagers and a mini-sofa for one or two in the window embrasure. Vault II (off No. 1) has a double bed and a similar window seat. Vault III (also off No.1) has one double and one single bed and a window seat. Vault III in turn gives access to Vault IV, a small single room with a three-light gothic window looking out onto the lawn.",
    "access": "For an extra fee of E160 for 3 days (or E300 for 7 days) a fishing boat is available between 1st March and 31st October. This includes outboard, life jackets, 2 fishing rods and an introduction to Lough Corrib by a local fisherman.",
    "notes": "You will have the whole property and 7 acres to yourselves. Carraigin Castle is ideal for a family reunion.\nCarraigin is very much a place of communal living which works well for people who know each other, as some of the rooms lead from one into the  other in ancient fashion. We generally recommend the place for 8 people to  be comfortable. Please also keep in mind that there are only 2 bathrooms. \nTower bedroom only available in the summer.\nThere is central heating, electric heaters and an open fire in the Great Hall.",
    "transit": "A car is necessary. The nearest town with shops, bank, post office, chemist etc is about 5 miles away.",
    "house_rules": "- check-in after 17.00 hours; check-out at 10.00 hours\n\n- There will be an additional charge for oil and electricity which will be taken from your damage deposit after your departure. On your arrival and departure the housekeeper will read the electricity and oil meter with you. The heating charge will be based on these readings and deducted from the guarantee deposit.  The average winter charge for three days has been around the Euro80 mark, the spring charge around the E35 mark. The central heating and electric radiators will be under your full control at all times.",

Highland cows in the adjacent field especially the calves were a great source of entertainment for the children and adults.  Apart from one door knob that kept falling off and one shower that leaked badly everything else worked.  Such a spacious property that you never felt that it was crowded.  Might be worth the hosts leaving cleaning chemicals for the hot tub with instructions as after 2 days of lots of use this would have helped keep the water cleaner. Just a short stroll from Barry Mill which is worth a visit. Would definitely go back.  Big thumbs up from all 17 of us that were there.",

The setting is rural and tranquil, and the touches like the hot tub and sauna were wonderful. We would not hesitate to recommend Ravensby Hall for large groups of friends or families!",

Lavender II - owner of Highlands Castle. \n \nHighlands Castle was born from a promise I made to my young son...\n“Someday I’ll build a house where we both will live… a place we’ll call home. \nA place where you can bring your friends and create special memories… someday Jason I will build you a castle.\" \n\nLooking back to 1978, my 3-year old son would likely have never remembered these words. The promise had more to do with a desire to build a better life, than an actual castle.  \n\nIt would be another 5-years before the ideal property presented itself, a mountaintop in Bolton Landing, NY.  \n\nWhile clearing the land for the foundation, a picture was being painted with a chain saw rather than a brush.  Within a matter of weeks, the most spectacular view in the world was uncovered.  The majesty of Lake George and the Adirondack Mountains seemed as grateful as I was to be unveiled.  How was it, that I would be the one to settle here?  Was it simply luck or something much greater? I believe it was the latter, and that I was led to this specific spot for a reason. \n\nOnce the foundation was completed, the wood framing construction was to the roof in a few months and the structure began to find its outward appearance.  I finally graduated from the living quarters of a tent to a mattress on the floor, which was fine with me… I was quite happy to be sleeping in my own home.\n\nIn 1986, I met Yvonne, the woman who 'turned a pile of rocks into a home'.  We were married here in 1992, and my parents who were both Methodist pastors officiated our ceremony.  (In 2008, my son Jason & Mary would be married at Highlands Castle with his grandparents also officiating their wedding). \n\n\"Jason, I promised that I would build you a castle, I didn't say you wouldn't be helping me!\"...  So, when Jason was a teenager, he joined in the stonework.  Naturally resourceful, he recruited his football teammates to lend some muscle over the summer months. Their daily mantra was \"Let's rock!\" and they took great pride in what they accomplished while working together again as a team.  (Jason was not only an impressive stonemason, but he also went on to earn an Architectural Engineering Degree, and achieve anything he put his mind to).\n\nThe stonework was a slow, tedious process and the labor of laying up more than 1,000 tons of local granite would take decades. Over the past 40+ years, the property would evolve into what it is today... a series of three castles.\n\nIn 2010, my wife Yvonne and I decided to make Highlands Castle available so others could experience what our family has been so fortunate to enjoy.   Since then, families & friends from all over the world have gathered here to create their own special memories.  We hope you'll visit us, too!\n\nPoised on a graceful mountainside overlooking majestic Lake George, a castle awaits you...  ",

We strongly believe that the first steps towards spectacular hospitality is taking care of our team and environments. Here, you'll meet the incredible Dunskey stewards who sincerely wish to share with you the joy, beauty, and warmth in all that we do. Most significantly, you will find extraordinary thoughtfulness in every moment of your journey here. \n\nWe are also a feministic company with a laser focus on sustainability. We use re-fillable products wherever possible. Our heating system is nearly at 100% sourced from renewable energy. We compost 100% of our food waste, and our water comes from a fresh spring. We continuously strive to do more and do better.\n\nOur ongoing other projects include policy advocacy in immigration and anti-human trafficking, working on turning out the votes in America and fighting against voter suppression laws. Seeking social and racial justice is a constant, though sometimes painful, anchor in our lives. We would like everyone to read the two novels, The Overstory, by Richard Powers, and, Ministry for the Future by Kim Stanley Robinson. When not heartened by the possibility of collective action to address climate change, we like to cook a ton-load of Vietnamese beef noodle soup and plot the next magic mushroom trail on the Estate.

Lovely, comfortable accommodation with a really well-equipped kitchen, great bathrooms ensuite in every room, spacious with a sea view and own beach 2 minutes away.  Furnishings and decor all to a high spec. Best kitchen knives I have experienced! Access to nature, the beach, woodlands on your doorstep.  Peaceful, calm lochs not far.  We had a great guided Ranger Walk over 3 hours and learnt lots about the local environment and what the estate is doing with it.  Loved it - highly recommended. Hope to return! Thank you.",

    "summary": "This is a private and self-contained apartment inside an Edwardian historic castle. Lovingly restored to the highest specs, but with all the charming original details: the art deco spiral staircase, blond wood floor, and classic windowpanes. Flooded with lights, full of modern comforts (speedy wifi, Smart TV, biomass heating) 2000 acres of glen walks, forests, beaches, lochs, gardens & waterfalls to explore. Vast lawn for games & courtyard for BBQ. 4 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms, sleeps 8 comfortably.",
    "space": "A fascinating fusion unfurls inside an Edwardian Castle in form of the apartment. There's an unusual architectural interplays within this unique Castle apartment, hidden down a private drive in deep Scottish countryside. At first glance, the Apartment is grandly presented inside a 19th-century castle, but a closer inspection reveals contemporary features dovetailed into the original design, cleverly expanding the space and light, to create a luxury self-catering homestay that's bespoke down to the last detail.\n\nTraditional vintage charm combines with boutique flair inside, with many secret spots to sit and absorb the tranquil grounds. Every effort has been made to preserve original features of the Castle, including the stripped-back blond hardwood floor, and the art deco spiral stairs case from a Glaswegian company at the height of its industrial heyday. History buffs will particularly delight at the original furniture, art works and artifacts dotted throughout the space.\n\nWith its double-floor loft style, the apartment will appeal to those with passion for architecture and history. Persian rugs cover the gorgeous reclaimed wood floor, original to the Castle. An arcadia mural stands prominently in the living room and family space. Mid-century leather sofa and gold coffee table, alongside leather rocking chairs and an upcycled wood burning stove will make sure you lounge in true Mad-Men style. A modern kitchen with muted jade colours and breakfast bar will encourage lengthy lingerings alongside poached eggs. With a nod to mid-century inspiration, ghost chairs around the dining area opens up the space to connect the kitchen and the lounge. \n\nFour bedrooms make slumberous havens. Plush wall-to-wall carpets are throughout the top floor, alongside three very spacious full bathrooms. The collection of beds in the apartment is definitely something to write home about: Italianate canopy bed, 18th-century antique mahogany single beds, linen-upholstered and brass-studded rococo bed, and the grand colonial style reclaimed wood bed will ensure the sweetest sleeps.",
    "access": "The 2000-acre Dunskey Estate is your private pleasure ground.

It is only accessible to our team members during this time.",
    "neighborhood": "You're not simply staying in a Castle: you are staying on one of the most beautiful spots on the planet.

The drawing room provided lots to entertain... billiards for the boys and a challenging jigsaw for the girls (even if a piece was missing!) Breakfast was to order... delicious \nThank you for providing an awesome experience, Griselda!! We will return!",

    "summary": "Traditional & relaxed B&B in the 16th century Scottish tower wing of our family home. 2 bedrooms for 4 people over two floors in a private wing of the house with large bathroom and small sitting room with tv.  Full breakfast included.",
    "space": "The castle dates from the 13th century and is full of original features but has been extensively improved for modern living! It is an excellent location for exploring the area or for business in Aberdeen or even a wedding at one of the excellent local venues.\nThe property is about 45 minutes’ drive south of Aberdeen off the main A90.  Edinburgh is 2 hours to the south.  Royal Deeside is about 20 minutes away, across the Cairn O’Mount pass.  \nOur main guest room is a bright room, overlooking parkland, on the second floor of the L-shaped tower built in 1531.  It has a superking sized bed and there is plenty of storage with a wardrobe & chest of drawers. A cosy sitting room with TV is adjacent.\nUp a further flight of the impressive stone spiral stair is the bathroom and a further guest room, with twin beds.  The bathroom, for exclusive use by guests, has a power shower and bath. \nAll linen, towels and basic toiletries will be provided.  Duvets and pillows are feather/down, but synthetic may be available. A hairdryer is available, as well as an iron & ironing board. There are tea and coffee making facilities and a fridge with ice box.  White waffle weave robes can be used for the short walk between the bedrooms and bathroom. \nOn the ground floor is a Billiard room with full sized billiard / snooker table and selection of board games which guests are welcome to use by separate arrangement.  On inclement days or chilly evenings we would be happy to light a fire.\nA full breakfast is provided in our dining room, depending on requirements. A selection of cereals, fruit juices and yoghurt are all available, with home made bread and preserves.  A simple cooked breakfast can be provided. \nFor larger parties there are other rooms available by arrangement.\nReasonable Wi-Fi is available throughout the house limited in places by the thickness of the walls!",
    "access": "The space is not suited to the infirm or very young because of the spiral stair between floors.\nGuests will be free to use the large garden, croquet lawn and all weather tennis court by arrangement. \nThe family use a separate wing of the house.",
    "notes": "We have two dogs which live outside, and a cat in our wing of the house. We also have chickens and ducks in the garden – there may well be fresh eggs for breakfast",
    "neighborhood": "The house is located in a tranquil and quiet rural setting midway between the villages of Fettercairn and Laurencekirk in the fertile farming area of the Howe of the Mearns. River and woodland walks are on the door step\nFettercairn has an award winning distillery with visitor centre. Slightly further afield over the Cairn O'Mount road, is Royal Deeside with Balmoral Castle and other attractions.\nThe property is not far from the coastal towns of Stonehaven, Catterline, Johnshaven and Montrose.  There are superb beaches at St Cyrus.\nThe nearest golf courses are in Edzell, Auchenblae, Montrose and Stonehaven.  Carnoustie and St Andrews are within an hour’s drive. \nThere is an abundance of walks and cycling for all abilities and interests on our doorstep. The coast to coast walk from Fort William passes through Glen Esk en route to Montrose. \nThe area has a number of excellent hotels, restaurants and coffee shops for eating out.",
    "transit": "Given the rural location a car is fairly essential, particularly as there are no places to eat within walking distance.  There is plenty of room to park. \nAs mentioned, the area is ideal for cycling and we can store bikes and any other sporting equipment under cover.",
    "interaction": "We will be around to answer any questions. We are very happy to chat and share our local knowledge but the large spaces in our property afford the guests their own privacy.",
    "house_rules": "We have a strict no smoking or vaping policy and no pets are allowed in the space. We request that our guests respect both our privacy and our property as we will do theirs.",

    "summary": "Mary Queen of Scot's chamber at Neidpath Castle is perhaps the most romantic place to stay in the Scottish Borders. Explore privately the whole castle and then retire to enjoy your suite rooms. The antique four poster bed, deep roll top bath and open fire evoke earlier times, but are truly comfortable and luxurious. An elegant table is set for breakfast. Peebles is 10 minutes walk away, with a host of shops and restaurants, as well as a museum and award winning chocolatier.",
    "space": "There is a small kitchenette with fridge, kettle and delicious provisions for a continental breakfast. Dinner can be served by prior arrangement and is subject to availability of the private chef. Please message for details.",
    "access": "Guests can explore the whole castle at their leisure. There is only the one bedroom suite.",
    "notes": "The chamber is on the 2nd floor of the castle, with no lift access.\n\nPets are welcome at a cost of £35 per pet, per stay. \n\nWhile we welcome pets, Neidpath Castle is a Grade A listed building and as such we would appreciate it if pets are kept under close supervision and any dog waste in the grounds is cleaned up and disposed of properly.",
    "neighborhood": "The glorious River Tweed, races past the castle below and you can follow it's banks into the heart of Peebles, where there are plenty of charming shops, cafes, pubs and restaurants.",
    "transit": "Peebles is a 2 minute drive from Neidpath. Edinburgh airport and train station  are 45 minutes away by car. There are lots of local taxi companies.",
    "interaction": "You will be met and shown to the apartment, and someone will be available at the end of a phone during your stay.",

There were a few minor things,  but nothing that detracted from our stay. Heads up, even with wifi, cell service was spotty, but that is no fault of the hostess. Loved the theme and decor. Maria made plenty of recommendations of things to do in the area. Kids took full advantage of the game room, (sometimes at 3am!😁) which had a pool table, air hockey, and Foosball.",

My children enjoyed the game run for hours on end and my wife and I were able to just relax in the yard and take in the surrounds of the beautiful grounds.  The host was very professional and accessible from the beginning to the end of our stay.   They answered any and all questions and made sure our stay was perfect.  Highly recommended location for sure!  Thanks for allowing us to make joyful memories in this lovely estate!",

Location is close to Bellport Village which is such a charming town. I would definitely rent from Maria again!",

Out of respect for my neighbors, I kindly ask that any loud outdoor music end by 8 pm.  \n\nEach room can accommodate two people.  The maximum amount of overnight guests is 10.\n\nYou may notice that rooms look different.

The four story peel tower is situated amongst the sheep pastures in the rolling hills, with the scenic River Tweed running nearby.  Extensive walking trails allow you to explore the beautiful countryside.  Within short driving distances, it is easy to visit the towns of Peebles, Selkirk, Melrose, and, a bit further away, the city of Edinburgh.\nOur host Lulu, or I should say, Lady Elizabeth Benson has done a marvelous job of restoring this old tower, preserving the historical nature while making it comfortable and cozy with all the amenities you need.  Be prepared to do a lot of climbing up and down the narrow, spiral stairs !  And watch your head upon entering through the original iron yett (gate) at the front door.  We really enjoyed \"soaking up\" the ambience of this tower -- it's like being in the show Outlander  : )\nOverall, Barns Tower is a remarkable experience.",

The renovations were obviously so lovingly and knowledgeably carried out and the result is a phenomenal treasure of a place. The tower was beautifully clean and all amenities were provided. They even left us essentials like bread, eggs, and milk. The fireplaces were also fantastic and our host left detailed instructions for use. \nThe grounds around the tower are breathtaking as well. There are beautiful idyllic walks around the property and a lovely path by the Tweed into Peebles. I have never wanted to not leave an Airbnb so much! Thank you to our hosts for sharing such a special place! 11/10 stars!!",

And I found that unique combination when I found Barns Tower. Consider the snuggly box-bed where I’d read late into the night, the open fires, the nascent, ghostly hoots of owls coming out to play with the stars, or the luxurious deep bath that amply takes two, it ticked everything off my list, and a few more things beside. There’s a wood and a walled garden within feet of the front door, and a multitude of walks just a little further on. Lulu and her team, including the formidably efficient Katarina, give a genuine welcome and are justifiably passionate about the area. Peebles itself is a brisk and friendly little market town, with its fair share of notable attractions, while day trips to Edinburgh and Glasgow make for a lively contrast. The area is sublime, the people wonderful, and if you go, you will never forget it.",

    "neighborhood": "Ulverston's central street is paved with cobblestones, and the town itself has a historic feel. It has many unique stores, cafes, and pubs serving up real fires and a variety of brews. From five-star restaurants to neighbourhood pubs, there is truly something for every palate. Ulverston is also well-known as a festival town, hosting a variety of events throughout the summer (including flag and walking festivals, as well as art and music festivals, and the world-famous Dickensian Christmas festival in late November). Stan Laurel was born there, and the town holds the record for the largest foam pie fight in the world, so you can imagine it's a pretty fun place to visit. It is possible to take pleasant strolls in the scenic countryside around Morecambe Bay and the southern Lake District. Featuring the world's deepest, widest, and shortest canal, this area is perfect for a leisurely stroll in the afternoon, thanks to the nearby pub and beautiful views of the bay. It's also easy to get to any of the National Park's sights. Beaches and excellent birdwatching can both be found along the Furness Coast. Popular Birkrigg Common, which offers breathtaking views of Morecambe Bay, is also close by, as is the South Lakes Wild Animal Park and Lakes Windermere and Coniston.",

You can lounge by the pool, grill, relax with a drink at night or dine in the lavish dining room - all of which we did and would absolutely do again. FYI considering this place has been in many movies the pictures really do not do it the justice it deserves !!!!\n\nCouldn’t have asked for more welcoming, genuine, down to earth hosts or a better location to get away with during unprecedented times - it’s really somewhere where you can balance relaxation with hiking, visiting breweries / cideries, antiquing and even visiting Baltimore in ~20 mins\n\nI would 100% recommend the property, the location and our gracious hosts to anyone in future and would hope to go back again some day",

    "space": "COVID note.  Absolutely NO POOL PARTIES \nWelcome to Lilburn Mansion, also known as the Castle! We appreciate your interest in this beautiful 160-year-old historic mansion that we call home. The Castle is our primary residence and our pride and joy. We welcome anybody that would like a chance to relax and enjoy the peace and serenity of our historic home. Our home has been host to productions that have appeared on Discovery Channel, Discovery Science, A&E, and full-length feature films.  The Castle is a tranquil setting in the woods but walking distance to beautiful, historic downtown old Ellicott City.  \n\nThe Castle is close enough to Baltimore, DC, and BWI to make it an excellent base for the National Capital Region. \n\nIf you are looking for a perfect romantic getaway or an opportunity for peace and solitude, we would love to be your hosts.  \n\nTo save a bit of time for you and us, we want to be precise. The Castle is not a party pad or location for obscene photoshoots or productions.  We do NOT rent our property for pool parties of any kind, so please do not ask.  \n\nPrice listed is based on up to 4 people and is not negotiable. Each additional person/child is $100 per night.\n\nWe do host weddings, tv/movie productions, professional photo shoots, and tasteful events.\nContact us for separate and additional pricing.",
    "access": "Kitchen, pool, grounds, outdoor spaces, library, ball room, basement for an extra charge. Beyond 4 guests will be at an extra charge.",
    "notes": "If the main house is rented the  owner some times stays in the basement with a separate entrance and locks from the main house inside. The owner may be at the pool or at another area outside. The owners will do their best to avoid guests outdoors so you will have a private visit. \n\nThe ballroom and library  is off limits for drinks and food unless contracted for an event. Food and drink are limited to the kitchen, dining room, and outdoors. Drink coasters and placemats  are provided to protect the surfaces of the dining room table. Please do not place drinks or other hot, cold or wet items  on other wood furniture or marble surfaces. Guests will be charged for damage to surfaces, rugs, and furniture. \n\nThe pool is for guests staying at the house only or as a decoration for an event. Absolutely no pool parties. Swimming is at your own risk and guests are liable for any incident that occurs in the pool. All safety rules must be abided by without fail. \n\nChildren must be supervised at all times in and around the home and pool.\n\nAll items in cabinets and shelves must remain in place. Please do not attempt to open locked or closed closets, cabinets, or drawers. Please don’t attempt to go above the second floor, attic, or basement.\n\nWiFi is provided on a limited basis and is spotty at best. We don’t guarantee a good connection so we specifically do not have WiFi listed as an amenity. The house is solid stone and has serious challenges with WiFi. \n\nThere is a county noise ordinance that must be obeyed at midnight. \n\nPlease don’t block the driveway of the neighbor, drive on our grass or park in the neighbors driveway.",

    "interaction": "As often as they like",
    "house_rules": "No parties unless contracted out for parties separately with the owner. TV productions, photo shoots, or events are different pricing please contact the owner.  We have hosted many TV productions and wedding here. Please respect the antiques and wood and don't place wet drinks or items that scratch or destroy antiques. Any wet ring damage to furniture, rugs, or surfaces will be charged to the guests staying. No food or drink  is allowed in the ballroom or library. All closets and cabinets  that are locked or closed throughout the house (minus the kitchen cooking supplies and dishes) must remain closed.

    "summary": "It's rare to find a place that's both historic and one of a kind. Tan-yr-Ogo Lodge is a castle conceived as one of a series of lodges to serve Gwrych Castle and was originally the principal and ceremonial entrance to the estate. Tan-yr-Ogo or more correctly, Tan yr Ogof, translates to 'beneath the cave', and is nestled below Lady Emily's Tower and the great cave of Cefn Yr Ogof, all part of the Gwrych Castle Estate.",
    "space": "Tan-yr-Ogo Lodge is a monumental gate lodge built as the ceremonial entrance to Gwrych Castle, forming courtyards and an elaborate complex of structures. \n\nThe rooms are in a recently refurbished elevated section of the complex providing a mini castle experience. The battlements contain four recessed sandstone inscription tablets. These commemorate various historical events which have taken place on this important strategic site over the past thousand years: \n\n1) the battle between Harold II and Griffith ap Llewelyn\n2) the routing of Hugh Lupus on his way to invade Anglesey\n3) the repulsion of Henry II by Owain Gwynedd\n4) the betrayal of Richard II by Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland, as imortalised in Shakespeare's history play. \n\nPassing under a huge stone Tudor-arched entrance gateway, into an inner courtyard, the drive turns ninety degrees and rises past more towers and walls to reveal the lodge itself. There are least eleven towers set within the curtain walls and the accommodation is set within two of the largest towers which are linked by a long gallery. \n\nACCOMMODATION:\nThe heavy oak door leads into a single storey barbican Entrance Hall which contains the Kitchen and Dining Room, leading to the Drawing Room with two sofa beds and a feature fireplace with a wood burning stove. A ground floor twin room is located in the West Tower and an adjacent oak staircase that is built over the exposed bedrock takes you to the first floor. There is also a recently refurbished downstairs cloakroom with sink and toilet. \n\nThe light and airy landing leads to the second bedroom which has bunk beds, along with the Art Deco bathroom with the benefit of an architect designed freestanding bath and walk-in shower. The long gallery leads to the Master Bedroom in the first floor of the East Tower, and provides breathtaking sea and countryside views. The master bedroom has an antique double four poster mahogany bed and the same spectacular views.\n\nTo the front of the lodge are extensive and private gardens for the whole family to enjoy, consisting of a seating area, lawn and access to Gwrych Castle’s 9 miles of permissive woodland walks.\n\nPLEASE NOTE:\nWe have The Gothic Bedroom which is a self-contained suite available within the complex, please see the last photo. This is available to let separately and has its own patio and parking space.\n\nGWRYCH CASTLE TICKETS:\nIf you would like to visit Gwrych Castle, we’re able to offer 25% off admission tickets. Once full payment has been made for your booking, please contact us to book your timeslot. Please check Gwrych Castle’s website for latest opening dates/times. Please ensure that you show proof of booking on arrival.",
    "access": "Guests are welcome to drop off and pick up from outside the front door into the lodge but we ask that they park in the designated parking spaces marked out.",
    "notes": "We are very low key and suit private minded guests. We won't bother you but our team will be available if you need anything. Please feel free to message us with any queries before or during your stay.",
    "neighborhood": "We are based in Llanddulas, on the Gwrych Castle Estate, in an exceptionally beautiful part of the North Wales coast. The locality is peppered with monuments, fine walks, castles, lovely tourist towns like Llandudno and Conwy, Snowdonia National Park and beautiful scenery in all directions. All this within an hour and a half's journey to Liverpool and Manchester by car or by train.",
    "transit": "The lodge is less than five minutes drive to Junction 23 of the A55 and is situated on the A547.  There are two bus stops outside the main gates which are on the principal routes. The closest railways stations are at Colwyn Bay (10 minutes drive) and Abergele-Pensarn (10 minutes drive).  No commercial vehicles or motor homes/caravans may be parked on the property.",
    "house_rules": "Please take great care when entering and exiting the lodge from the A547. It can be a very fast road and due to the large towers, blind spots exist. \n\nPlease keep all dogs under control in the grounds of the lodge as there may be gaps in fences to the surrounding land. \n\nPlease be respectful of other guests staying at the lodge.",

    "neighborhood": "Ulverston is an old-fashioned market town with a cobblestone central street. There are many unique stores, cafes, and pubs to explore, all of which serve up delicious food and cold pints of beer. A wide variety of restaurants, from upscale eateries to neighbourhood pubs, are available to satisfy any appetite. Ulverston is well-known as a festival town, hosting events like the Flag and Walking Festival, the Art and Music Festival, and the World-Famous Dickensian Christmas Festival, all throughout the summer and into late November. Stan Laurel was born in this town, and the annual foam pie fight held there holds the record for largest in the world. Great walks in scenic countryside with views of Morecambe Bay and the southern Lake District can be found all around the town. The deepest, widest, and shortest canal in the world can be found here, and it makes for a great afternoon stroll with a pub and bay views at its conclusion. The National Park's various points of interest can also be quickly and conveniently reached. Sand beaches and excellent birdwatching can be found along the Furness Coast. The South Lakes Wild Animal Park, Lakes Windermere and Coniston, and the breathtaking views of Morecambe Bay from Birkrigg Common are all within easy driving distance and are great for families.",

The bedrooms were large, beds comfortable, bathrooms small but had nice showers and water pressure, kitchen had plenty of dishes, cooking pans and utensils, and the grounds were manicured to perfection!  We explored every inch of the castle, the ruins and secret tunnels!  The location was good for driving to Southern Ireland towns like Wexford, Cork, Waterford, Kilkenny and Cashel.  It’s about 1.5 hours to Dublin..  We even drove a day trip to Limerick and The Cliffs of Moher which was quite a long day but totally worth it!   Wilton Castle is amazing and a very special, unique, surprise for your family!  We highly recommended picking this place for your Ireland vacation!",

We would love to return if we are in the area again \nJanet and family",

It was comfortable, clean, stocked well and was really just the perfect spot for a little get away. Our university aged kids loved the chapel. The art work was eclectic and fit the space perfectly. The local attraction cards were a great touch. We would absolutely  recommend and revisit!",

We love the kitchen, it is spacious and was perfect for our food truck staff to prepare for the event.  2 of us were DJs booked for the event and the wifi was important for us.  Super fast internet, I did not need to use my Starlink.  I was also able to charge my Tesla with my regular 120V connector under the deck/beside the stairs which was easy to get to.\n\nArt has pretty much everything thought-out for the entire venue.  Although it is a church converted to a residential living quarters, it's got an interesting twist of unique art throughout the place.  \n\nArt's place will definitely be on the list for Berlin Klassik staff!\n\nThank-you again Art!",

I would definately go back. 5 star.",

A signed paper contract is required to be completed and returned to Vacasa.\n - Property Specific terms: \n\nDAMAGE WAIVER\r\n\r\nThe total cost of your reservation for this Property includes a damage waiver fee (USD) with the following costs, plus tax if applicable:\r\n0 bedrooms: $60 for stays 1-3 nights, $15 per night for stays 4+ nights.\r\n1 bedrooms: $60 for stays 1-3 nights, $15 per night for stays 4+ nights.\r\n2 bedrooms: $80 for stays 1-3 nights, $20 per night for stays 4+ nights.\r\n3 bedrooms: $100 for stays 1-3 nights, $25 per night for stays 4+ nights.\r\n4 bedrooms: $100 for stays 1-3 nights, $25 per night for stays 4+ nights.\r\n5 bedrooms: $120 for stays 1-3 nights, $30 per night for stays 4+ nights.\r\n6 bedrooms: $120 for stays 1-3 nights, $30 per night for stays 4+ nights.\r\n7 bedrooms: $140 for stays 1-3 nights, $35 per night for stays 4+ nights.\r\n8 bedrooms: $140 for stays 1-3 nights, $35 per night for stays 4+ nights.\r\n\r\nThe Damage Waiver covers you for up to $3,000 of accidental damage to the Property or its contents (such as furniture, fixtures, and appliances) as long as you report the incident to Vacasa prior to checking out. The Damage Waiver fee eliminates the need for a traditional security deposit.\r\n\r\nHow to Report Damage\r\nPlease report accidental damage as soon as it occurs so we can assess and minimize the extent of the damages. \r\n\r\nDamage Waiver Additional Terms and Conditions\r\nThe Damage Waiver only covers damage that occurs during the authorized rental period and that Renter or an authorized guest reports PRIOR TO CHECK OUT.\r\nThe Damage Waiver does not cover intentional damage or damage caused by smoking, pets or other animals brought onto the Property, or criminal activity.\r\nThe Damage Waiver does not cover damage to any structure other than the Property covered by your confirmed, non-fraudulent reservation.\r\nRenter is responsible for any accidental damage that exceeds $3,000. Damages for covered claims in excess of $3,000 or for uncovered claims will be charged to the Renters credit card.\r\nThe Damage Waiver program is provided and administered by Vacasa and is not an insurance policy. The Damage Waiver does not provide liability coverage and does not cover vehicles or guest personal items.\r\n\r\n\n\n\nADDITIONAL TERMS FOR VACASA ACCOMMODATIONS\n\nThese Additional Terms for Vacasa Accommodations, including any applicable Unit-Specific Terms (as defined below) (collectively, the “Vacasa Terms”), apply to your Airbnb booking of the vacation rental property specified in a confirmed reservation (the “Property”). In case of any conflict between the Vacasa Terms and the Airbnb Terms of Service (“Airbnb Terms”) that apply to your reservation, the Airbnb Terms will control.\n\nThese Vacasa Terms are between: (1) Vacasa (“Vacasa,” “we,” or “us”), acting for itself and for the owner of the Property (“Owner”), and (2) the person who is the responsible renter of the Property (collectively “Renter” or “you”). You acknowledge that you have read and understand, and agree to be bound by, all terms, conditions, and policies in these Vacasa Terms.\n\nCertain jurisdictions, resorts, and specific homes require renters to agree to additional terms and conditions (“Unit-Specific Terms”). If any provision of the Unit-Specific Terms differs from the general provisions of the Vacasa Terms, the provision of the Unit-Specific Terms will control.\n\nVacasa operates using different legal entities in different geographical regions. As used in these Vacasa Terms, the term “Vacasa” means the entity specified in the Unit-Specific Terms, if any. If no entity is specified in the Unit-Specific Terms, then:\n·   If the Property is located in the United States or Mexico, Vacasa means Vacasa LLC.\n·   If Property is located in Europe (meaning one of the countries of the European Union or Switzerland), Vacasa means Vacasa Europe AG.\n·   If the Property is located in Canada, Vacasa means Vacasa Canada ULC.\n·   If the Property is located in South Africa, Vacasa means Vacasa South Africa (PTY) Ltd.\n·   If the Property is located in one of the following countries in Latin America or the Caribbean, then Vacasa means:\n            o   In Belize: Vacasa Belize Ltd.\n            o   In Chile: Vacation Rental SpA\n            o   In Colombia: Vacasa Colombia S.A.S.\n            o   In Costa Rica: Vacasa del Pacífico Central de Costa Rica Ltda\n            o   In the Dominican Republic: Vacasa, S.A.S.\n            o   In Honduras: Vacasa Honduras S. DE R.L.\n            o   In Nicaragua: Vacasa Nicaragua S.R.L y CÍA LTDA\n            o   In Uruguay: Vacasa Uruguay, S.R.L.\n\n\nPOLICIES AND ADDITIONAL TERMS\n\nA. Minimum Age. The “Minimum Age” to rent the Property is the age specified in any Unit-Specific Terms. If no age is specified in the Unit-Specific Terms, the Minimum Age is 21 years of age (or the minimum age required by law in the jurisdiction where the Property is located, if different). You agree to provide us with proof of age upon request. A parent or legal guardian must accompany all guests who are under the Minimum Age for the entire duration of the rental.\n\nB. Maximum Occupancy.  The number of people present at the Property may not exceed the maximum posted occupancy.\n\nC. Good Neighbor Policy.  Because the Property is a privately owned home, all Occupants must comply with this good neighbor policy:\n-   Please treat the Property with the same care you would use with your own residence and leave it in the same condition it was in when you arrived.\n-   To prevent theft of or damage to furnishings or your personal property, you agree to close and lock doors and windows when you are not present at the Property and upon check-out.\n-   You and other Occupants agree to conduct yourselves throughout your stay in a manner that is respectful of and not disruptive to neighbors, traffic flow, or the community and that will not prompt complaints to Vacasa from police, neighbors, or neighborhood or homeowner associations.\n-   Noise audible outside the Property is prohibited between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m.\n-   You and other Occupants agree to abide by all applicable parking restrictions and limitations.\n\nD. No Smoking.  No smoking is permitted at the Property (including porches, decks or outdoor areas) at any time.\n\nE. No Permanent Residence. You agree that your use of the Property is on a temporary and transient basis only; that you may not use the Property as a permanent residence; and that your permanent residence is and will remain elsewhere than at the Property.\n\nF. Animals.  We accept assistance animals in line with Airbnb's Nondiscrimination Policy. No other animals or pets of any kind are permitted at the Property except as specifically authorized in your reservation. You also agree that we cannot and do not guarantee that no animals have been in the Property prior to your use or that the Property is free of animal or pet allergens, even if the Property listing states that pets are prohibited or includes a similar description.\n\nG. Events; Commercial Photography; Structures; Charcoal Grills. Parties and other events are prohibited at the Property. Commercial photography and filming are also prohibited at the Property without our express written permission. (If approved, applicable occupancy limits and other rules under Airbnb's Party and Events Policy will apply, and additional conditions and fees may apply.) No tents or other structures may be erected on the property. The use of charcoal grills is prohibited.\n\nH. Criminal Activity Prohibited. Use of the Property for any criminal activity is prohibited and may result in fines, prosecution, and/or your immediate removal from the Property. This prohibition extends to use of the Property’s internet service, if any, for criminal activity, including but not limited to unlawful downloads of copyrighted material, including movies, music, software, or other material. We may cooperate with any investigation of alleged criminal activity that occurred at the Property during your stay.\n\nI. Consequences of Breach; Charges for Damage. Any failure by you or any other Occupants to comply with any of the terms, conditions, or policies above is a breach of these Vacasa Terms and may result in a forfeiture of your rights to rent the Property, up to and including immediate removal from the Property without refund and with or without the assistance of law enforcement. Vacasa may terminate your occupancy of the Property for breach, and if you are notified of such termination you agree to leave the Property immediately. In addition, subject to Airbnb’s damage claim policies, you are responsible for (1) any damage or loss that occurs at the Property during your stay; (2) a charge of up to $1,000 for violations of the pet policy, including for bringing more pets or different types of pets than specifically authorized; (3) an additional cleaning fee of up to $500 (or the actual cost of cleaning services, if greater) for violations of any of the guest policies above (other than the pet policy) or for excessive cleaning required by the acts or omissions of any Occupant during your stay; and (4) any fines issued by police, other government officials or agencies, utility providers, and/or homeowner associations for violation of any law, ordinance, or rule during your stay, and any damages (which may exceed the amount of fines) that result from the violation. If any unauthorized download of copyrighted material via the Property’s Internet service occurs during the period of your stay, you agree that we may obtain and share your contact information with the internet service provider or any other party we believe, for any reason, has enforcement rights.\n\nJ. Early Check-In/Late Check-Out.  Early check-in or late check-out may be available; additional charges may apply. If you do not vacate by check-out time (or late check-out time as agreed by Vacasa), you authorize us to charge a late departure fee of up to one night’s rental and we may remove all Occupants and their personal property from the Property.\n\nK. Maintenance or Housekeeping Issues; Property Conditions. The Property is provided as is, and we are not responsible for the inoperability or unavailability of any amenities. You agree to contact Vacasa, using the contact information provided in your confirmation email, as soon as you notice any maintenance or housekeeping problem, or any potentially hazardous condition, at the Property, or if any incident occurs at the Property that is related to such a problem or condition. You further agree to give Vacasa a reasonable amount of time to respond to your report and to cooperate with Vacasa’s efforts to address the concern or provide a remedy. We will take reasonable and appropriate steps to remedy any reported problem as soon as practicable. We may enter the Property at your invitation to remedy any problem you report, at reasonable times and with reasonable notice to inspect, maintain, or repair the Property, and to address any situation that we reasonably deem an emergency that threatens persons or property. You acknowledge that if the Property has access to amenities that are shared with other properties, such as a shared pool, hot tub, parking lot, or fitness center, that the availability and condition of those amenities is outside Vacasa’s control.\n\nL. Choice of Law; Jurisdiction and Venue; Dispute Resolution.\n\nL.1. Choice of Law. Unless otherwise specified in any Unit-Specific Terms or if a different choice of law is required by the law of the jurisdiction in which the Property is located: If the Property is outside Europe, these Vacasa Terms shall be governed by laws of the State of Oregon, U.S.A, without regard to its conflict-of-law provisions. If the Property is in Europe, these Vacasa Terms shall be governed by the laws of Switzerland, without regard to its conflict-of-law provisions.\n\nL.2. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement: United States. If (a) your claim against Vacasa relates in any way to a reservation for or stay at a Property located in the United States, or (b) you bring any other claim against Vacasa in the United States (to the extent permitted by these Vacasa Terms or the Airbnb Terms) (any such dispute, claim, or controversy under either (a) or (b) a “US Claim”), then you agree to resolve the US Claim as follows:\n\na. Agreement to Arbitrate. You and Vacasa mutually agree that any US Claim will be settled by binding arbitration rather than in court, such arbitration to be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules, or such other AAA arbitration rules that the AAA decides to be applicable to a specific dispute, that are in effect as of the time of service of an arbitration demand. Payment of filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. To begin an arbitration, a party must send a letter to the other party requesting arbitration and describing the claim. If Vacasa requests arbitration, it will send the letter to your most recent email or physical address in Vacasa’s records. If you request arbitration, you must send the letter to Vacasa’s registered agent in the state in which the Property you reserved or stayed at is located, or if the dispute does not involve a reservation for or stay at a specific property, to Vacasa’s registered agent in the state of Oregon.\n\nb. Place of Arbitration. The arbitration shall take place in the county in which the Property is located, or in Portland, Oregon, if the dispute does not involve a reservation for or stay at a specific property, or in such other location as you and Vacasa may mutually agree.\n\nc. Exceptions to Arbitration Requirement. As the only exceptions to the agreement to submit all US Claims to binding arbitration as provided herein, Vacasa and Renter both retain the right to pursue: (1) in small claims court in the county in which the Property is located (or if the dispute does not involve a reservation for a specific property, the small claims court for Multnomah County, Oregon), any claim that is within that court’s jurisdiction, and the parties consent to the personal jurisdiction and venue of such court; and (2) a suit in any court with jurisdiction to enjoin (whether by temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunctive relief) infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.\n\nL.3. Dispute Resolution: Outside the United States.\nEurope: If you are a resident of Europe and your claim relates in any way to a reservation for or stay at a Property located in Europe, you and Vacasa consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts in Zurich or Zug, Switzerland. If applicable law prohibits exclusive jurisdiction over your claim in Switzerland, then you and Vacasa agree to the non-exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts in Zurich or Zug, Switzerland, or your jurisdiction of residence.\nOutside Europe: If your claim relates in any way to a reservation for or stay at a Property located outside of Europe or the United States, you and Vacasa agree to bring any action in the courts of the country in which the Property is located, or in such other location and forum as you and Vacasa may mutually agree.\n\nL.4. Class Action and Jury Trial Waiver. You and Vacasa agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, you and Vacasa waive any right to a jury trial.\n\nM. Limitation of Liability. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO CASE SHALL THE OWNER OF THE PROPERTY OR VACASA, NOR THEIR AFFILIATES, NOR THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, OR OWNERS, BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY DAMAGES FOR PERSONAL OR BODILY INJURY, EMOTIONAL DISTRESS, OR DAMAGE TO PROPERTY, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR STAY AT THE PROPERTY. THIS LIMITATION APPLIES TO ALL CLAIMS FOR DAMAGES WHETHER BASED ON A THEORY OF WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING ORDINARY NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF VACASA HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE AND EVEN IF THE  LIMITED REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.\n\nN. Indemnity. You agree to hold harmless and indemnify Vacasa and Owner, and their respective affiliates, for and from all claims for property damage, personal injury, or monetary loss resulting from your actions or omissions, and the actions or omissions of other Occupants, during or relating to your stay.\n\nO. Substitution of Property. On rare occasions, due to ownership changes, properties being removed from rental use, or a need for extensive repairs or maintenance, the Property may not be available for rental on the dates of your reservation and Vacasa may have to cancel your booking. In this unlikely event, rebooking shall be subject to the Airbnb Terms for booking modifications.\n\nP. Assignment. Vacasa may assign these Terms or any of its rights, or delegate any of its duties under these Terms, at any time without your consent.",

So, when Kilmartin Castle went up for sale, a few weeks after our holiday ended, we couldn't resist starting a new adventure. We sold all our worldly possessions and bought it. Simon was a Creative Director and I was a Travel Journalist & Radio Broadcaster. We spent 6 months renovating Kilmartin Castle in 2019 and now we are very excited to share it with you! \n\nWe live at the castle with our super friendly cat, King Frank, whilst offering bed and breakfast and when the castle is booked for exclusive use all three of us head off travelling in our campervan. \n\nWell behaved dogs, and cats are welcome at Kilmartin Castle.

A very short drive to trailheads leading to castles, cairns, standing stones and rock art.  We hired two of the chefs that Stef and Simon recommended for cooking dinners in the castle, and can't recommend that highly enough.  Less than an hour drive up to Oban for a nice day outing and Whisky tasting.  Of course, is a castle... lots of precarious stair climbing and no air conditioning.  As you would expect.",

    "summary": "Restoration of 16th Century Kilmartin Castle was completed in 2019. Located within the ancient landscape of Kilmartin Glen surrounded by 8,000 years of history. Standing stones, ancient hill forts, stone circles, burial tombs, & ancient rock carvings make this Glen one of Europe's most important areas, archeologically. Kilmartin Castle was Named #4 Best Places to Go in the World in  2023 by The New York Times",
    "space": "When we travelled around Scotland, as tourists, we were disappointed that we couldn't find a castle to stay in that 'felt like a castle' once inside. We found a castle that had dodged the Victorian home improvement brigade, quit our sensible jobs, and set about creating the experience for visitors that we had hoped for. Plasterboard and down lighters became the modern day enemy of Kilmartin Castle! \n\nAn authentic castle retreat, welcoming and warm, rustic and honest. The castle walls and floors have been deliberately left with their original aged patina. Interiors are a mix of antique furniture and original artworks and objects that we have lovingly collected over time. The kitchen is well equipped with two Bosch ovens, Neff induction hob, fridge freezer and a dishwasher so no-one has to draw the short straw there. The dining room sits 8-10 guests and the grand hall is a fabulous place to gather around the fire. A HD projector and retractable movie screen  transforms the grand hall into your own personal theatre room for movie nights together. The whisky snug is an excellent place to sneak off to with a good read. All five en suite bedrooms have been individually designed to retain the rustic magic of a 16th century castle while spoiling you with the comforts of modern living including wood burning stoves, extravagant walk in showers, roll top copper baths and of course, luxury bedding.\n\nOur gardens have been landsacped by the award winning Chelsea Flower show garden designer Amber Crowley to include a bio diverse wild swimming pool, outdoor kitchen, orchard, sunken fire-pit, dining table and outdoor living space with a wood buring stove. The outdoor kitchen is full equipped with crockery, cutlery and hot running water sink. There is a large Kamado Joe, a BBQ and a pizza oven. \n\nWe grow our own organic veggies, fruits, and herbs at the castle which you are welcome to enjoy. A stone shed has become outside toilets, complete with wood burner. This new addition is convenient for events, small weddings or anyone in need of a visit whilst enjoying the gardens. In early 2023 we will be building a glasshouse which will become a dining room in the garden providing shelter whould there be a Scottish rain shower whilst you are barbecueing. \n\nWiFi: We have a fast fibre optic broadband connection at the castle and 6 routers placed throughout, which automatically reconnect as you walk through the building. We understand that a lot of people like to be disconnected whilst travelling but at the same time it's nice to have the option and to be able to watch Netflix on an iPad if you choose to do so. \n\nKilmartin Castle is the perfect place for a small wedding or elopements of up to 10 guests. Let us know if you have a few extras and we may be able to help.  The great thing about Scotland being that you can say 'I do' anywhere you like, as we did in the castle garden back in 2016.\n\nThere is a wedding surcharge of £1000 on the price of holiday accommodation should you wish to hold your wedding whilst staying at Kilmartin Castle. This includes a list of extra benefits including introduction to our personally selected group of wedding suppliers; private chef, celebrant, bagpiper, photography, floral designer, hair and makeup artists.",
    "access": "Kilmartin Castle is yours to rule throughout your stay. Enjoy! As it takes a while to make the place lovely and clean for you, we do have to strictly stick to our check in and out times. We will welcome you with open arms from 4pm on the day of your arrival and be waving goodbye no later than 10am on the day of your departure. \n\nIf you do arrive earlier than 4pm the good folk at the Kilmartin pub, are always happy to see you.",
    "notes": "We’ll happily introduce you to our private chef who can prepare an amazing locally sourced 3-5 course dinner for you in the castle dining room. We'll put you directly in touch to talk menus and prices once the booking is confirmed. She also makes a mean breakfast/brunch.",
    "neighborhood": "Kilmartin Glen has the largest number of historical finds within a six mile radius in all of Scotland. You can set off on amazing walks from the front door. We often describe it as an outdoor museum. Kilmartin Village has a great community vibe, an award winning museum / café and gift shop and a local pub serving real ales, Scottish single malts and great dinner, only a 3 minute walk away.",
    "transit": "In the village everything is within walking distance. We recommend you hire a car though so you can make the most of the surrounding areas. In the summer island hopping is a lot of fun and there are some incredible, off the beaten track restaurants to discover.",
    "interaction": "We are only a phone call away. Since its renovation, the castle is very good at looking after itself, so you shouldn't have any issues during your stay.",
    "house_rules": "The castle is in a small village in the countryside. We ask that all of our guests respect the village by driving at a snails pace through it (children and cats roam free) and also do not make a noise nuisance. \n\nFireworks are a strict NO as we are surrounded by farmland.",

Within the same afternoon we booked (just a few hours before we planned to arrive) he had a full itinerary for our stay, along with accommodating food preferences. He is truly an asset to the castle. Food was excellent, and we really appreciated the kind mannerisms and attention to detail from the staff. We would recommend this to anyone! 100/10 experience.",

This was a 60th birthday celebration for a number of us and from the moment we arrived until the moment we left we felt like royalty.  The food was amazing!  Chef Ben was flexible with our schedule and accommodated the one member of our party with a seafood aversion.  We did a self guided hike to the caves and made only one wrong turn along the way - but that just meant more time in the woods!  The last section down to the caves was a little too steep for some of the group with bad knees.  We spent a lot of our time on the patio over the front entrance way.  The view from there is unreal from sun up to sun down.  We brought our own \"beverages\" and set up in the bar area when we first arrived, this worked out real well.    Thanks Chef Ben and your team for an unbelievable weekend.",

The house was breathtaking, accommodations of the rooms were thoughtful and comfortable. We had a great night sleep and slept with our balcony doors open. Just to wake up to the birds chirping a melody to us. I can see why so many couples love it here, the fireplaces, 360 view and architectural charm is more than along ambiance. It just transports you.  I love all the Castle Decor and unique touches throughout the house. I never sat at a dining room and sat on a 150 year old table and chair for breakfast and dinner by candlelight. But the true gem of this already scenic storybook stay is Chef Benjamin. I honestly need an hour or so to just write a review on him. To sum it up, absolutely PHENOMENAL. Hands down one of the best Chef Pairings and combinations of dishes to shock your palate. I consider myself a great cook and appreciate distinguished service and talent. The attention to detail of presentation and the burst of flavors and combos to each meal was truly exceptional.  Chef took the time to carefully think of everything to have the full experience. Wine Pairings we’re superb. For example, I absolutely loved his Bison Lasagna and Lemon Pepper Vinaigrette Dressing with Dragon Fruit over arugula salad was my favorite. It sounds simple but has a complexity of depth in the flavors that you really have to have on your bucket list. BRAVO to such talent and passion to the dishes you prepare. We appreciated the two lady staff serving us. THANK YOU Clara and Rebecca. Always smiling and so attentive and sweet. Thank you Smithmoore Castle for hosting us. We look forward to visiting again.",

It was wonderful to have a big house for the whole family to stay in, and to have a big outdoor area to host guests for an outdoor lunch. We may have been one of the first guests to stay at the Strawberry Castle, so there was a bit of stuff that was not quite ready-for-prime-time, but everything got handled and the hosts were very quick to respond to questions and requests. Beds were EXCELLENT -- so comfortable, and each bedroom upstairs has its own bathroom, which was a great convenience.  It is an old house (1883), so it's got its fair share of quirks, but that's 100% to be expected. The kitchen is all brand-new and sparkling, with easy access to the (sun-heated) pool and yard.",

We hosted thanksgiving for our family at the house, so we did a lot of cooking and their dining table holds 10👍🏼.There were 3 bedrooms, believe the beds were tempurpedic, they were very comfortable. Beautiful, well maintained property on 3 acres. Lovely patio and pool area. They were sweet enough to allow dogs, and my yellow lab enjoyed walking on the 3 acres! I’ll definitely do it again in the summer when the pool is open.",

We had a group of 11 folks traveling to Scotland from the USA to participate in the Dramathon - a trail marathon along the Speyside.   Large group accommodations aren't easy to come by in the area, but when we found Lickleyhead Castle on Airbnb, it seemed like a once in a lifetime opportunity.  It was even better than we thought!  Every room has a unique character tied to the history of the castle, the grounds are amazing, James and his family are gracious hosts.  The castle is a OLD building, but it has been updated to bring modern comforts while still maintaining the historic character.  \n\nJames also arranged a falconry demonstration for us - that was truly an epic experience as well.  Thank you for being a key unforgettable part of an awesome trip!",

    "summary": "Lickleyhead Castle is a Grade A listed historic building from the 16th century. It can accommodate up to 16 adults, 4 children and 3 dogs. Despite it's grandeur  the castle feels very much like a home with the 5 working fireplaces and the overwhelming smell of woodsmoke which greets you as you climb the stone staircase. Outside, the sound of running water and abundant birdlife combine to provide an atmosphere of peace and calm. We also host weddings.",

The lighting was wonderful inside the home as you can choose an evening setting to set the mood. We appreciated the access to Netflix and the cable tv. The washer and dryer in the closet was an awesome surprise and allowed us to do a small load of laundry before we set back off home. The bed was comfortable and the couches were comfy. Thank you for a lovely stay!",

The pictures honestly don't do it justice! It's amazing, and would be perfect for a team-building location, or themed event. \n\nThe NOT-SO-GOOD: this place was basically like glamping. Not the amenities (the bed was fine, running hot water, etc). But there were bugs in every corner. I counted at least 3 large spiders in the master bathroom (i had to kill one, since it was hanging out near the toilet...).  Cobwebs at every turn. Then the master bathroom itself was just, 'old dirty' (the kinda dirty that only exists in like, hoarder houses), specifically the sink and shower. A simple replacement would rectify this. It'll be fine if you plan on using the other restrooms, but it was just the two of us, and i didn't wanna dirty up another restroom.",

We wore the crowns and pranced around the second floor library lol.\nPlayed their table tennis, drank at the pub style bar, found secret room, fenced, took endless pics and walked to a beautiful quarry named Ijams. Ijams also has a swimming hole that’s pretty fun. It had a great hiking trail! \nSlept 4 nicely. Both kids had their own room, as well as us. Was 10 min drive to downtown for dinners.  Gated driveway was nice. Only thing that stumped us a little was the spiderwebs. Outside mostly but you’ll get over it. We wanted to open a few windows to get fresh air but the screens were too full of the spiderwebs. \nSo aside from that it was fantastical and so much fun!!\nWe found some clues too and ended up on a hunt! If you love Scottish heritage and castles this is a must experience! It’d be best if you had 1girl & 1boy for fitting room Decor.",

There is so much living space, that even with 9 people I could still hear my thoughts. The kitchen truly is the heart of the home, only to be made more cozy if we had made some stew.  The bedrooms were all spacious and beautifully decorated, the beds cozy, the water pressure great. Outdoors there are more places to have a fire or sit and enjoy the soft moos in the distance and castle ambience than we knew what to do with.  My only complaint about the outdoor seating is that the weather didn’t cooperate very well for us to enjoy the water and cow overlook, though we spent every evening by a fire. I would stay here again, and I would live here if I could!",

Everything went perfect and we particularly enjoyed cooking together in the spacious and well equipped kitchen which became the main room for us to come together. The salon and the petit salon were more used for reading or playing piano. As it was wintertime it was a bit chilly and wet outside, so we could not use the garden. Nevertheless we had an unforgettable week in Queblen and would definitely recommend Jame's and Elsa's family chateau for someone who is looking for something special.",

  "description": {
    "summary": "Château de Québlen has five renovated bedrooms ready for you to stay (sleeping 10 people). We hope to have the whole house ready someday, but for now you will be staying in the west part (Côté  Métairie) while the east side (Côté Terrace) waits its turn. \nNestled in 50 acres of ancient forest, it is a short drive (15 mins) from the beautiful beaches of Le Pouldu. The charming town of Quimperlé is a 5 minute drive away.",
    "space": "Ground Floor:\nEntrance Hall – a medieval entrance with stone floor and walls, and original wooden beams running across the ceiling.\nSalon – an elegant sitting room with a marble fireplace and windows over-looking the garden.\nPetit Salon - a cosy television room.\nKitchen – Light, spacious and well-equipped. A large dining table seats twelve people.\nCellar - a gravelled room off the kitchen with pantry shelves, which also serves as boiler room and store room.\nDownstairs loo – located in the back hall, near the staircase.\n\nFirst Floor:\nPetite Chambre - a lovely twin bedroom overlooking the front lawn.\nChambre d’Olive - A double bedroom overlooking the front lawn.\nBathroom - A large Jack and Jill bathroom shared by chambre d’Olive and La Petite Ferme with freestanding bath and double sink unit.\nLa Petite Ferme - A double bedroom overlooking the front lawn.\nUpstairs loo - located along the main corridor\nShower Room - A comfortable shower room for your convenience.\nLa Lingerie - a twin bedroom, which also serves as the utility room with linen press, washing machine and tumble dryer.\nBathroom - A Jack and Jill bathroom between the lingerie and chambre de l’évêque, with bath and loo.\nChambre de L'Évêque - A large medieval double bedroom, accessible via the main spiral staircase.\n\nOutside:\nQueblen is set in 40 acres of private land. The house is surrounded by a garden of lawns, mature trees and shrubs, and framed by an old 16th century farmhouse (la métairie) and dovecote (le pigeonnier). A croquet set, table tennis table, and BBQ are available for your enjoyment. A outside dining table with umbrella seats 10 people. \n\nOver the hedge (separate from the main house) lives our friendly cousin.\n\nRestoration:\nAlthough the house has been in our family for hundreds of years, it has not been continuously lived in for the past 50 years. Almost all the rooms were in need of work, but we have had to focus on the western end (côté métairie) for now. You will be staying in this part of the house, and won’t have access to the eastern end (côté terrace). To learn more about the work we have completed, please visit our website.",
    "notes": "Babes in arms and children over 6 years old are very welcome. However, Québlen is an old home with some uneven floors and numerous small and large stairways. There is also an unfenced terrace in the garden. Therefore, we do not routinely accept children below this age. \n\nAll children should be supervised. For your safety, all guests should remain in the renovated part of the house.",
    "neighborhood": "Things to do :\nBeaches - We are spoilt for choice when it comes to beaches. The beaches of Le Pouldu are 15 minutes drive from the house. Our favourites are Plage du Kerou and la Roche Percée.\nSailing, windsurfing and kite surfing - Water sports schools are all under half an hour from Québlen.\nSurfing - The KLOAR surf school is 15 minutes from the house, paddle boarding also available.\nWalking - For the walking enthusiasts, the famous GR34 trail travels 2000km along the Breton Coast. It was once a path that allowed customs officers to travel along the coast to prevent smuggling; today it is a peaceful hiking trail celebrated for its beauty.  These routes begin a short walk away from the house in neighbouring Lothea.\n\nCycling - This is excellent cycling country, reasonably flat and, with the “Espace VTT Cornouaille” circuits, the surrounding countryside can be easily explored. Bicycles can be hired and delivered directly to Québlen.\nKayaking - The canoe/kayak club of Quimperlé is just a 5 minute drive from Québlen. Paddle to the coast down the Laïta river and they will pick you up and drive you back to the club !\nGolf - The stunning golf courses of Golf de Cornouaille and Golf de Ploemeur Ocean are within easy reach of the house (both are 35 mins drive away).\nHorse Riding - The best way to explore the Forêt de Carnoët which surrounds Québlen is perhaps on horse back. 5 minutes drive from Québlen, at the Centre d’Équestre de Lothéa, you will be able to do just that.\nFishing - Trout streams are plentiful near Québlen and guided fly-fishing trips can be organised to help you make the best from your day on the river.",
    "transit": "Situated on the south coast of Brittany, 2.5km from the charming town of Quimperlé, Québlen enjoys a peaceful rural location a short drive from the Atlantic Coast.\nThere are excellent shopping facilities in Quimperlé, with large supermarkets, multiple boulangeries, specialist charcuteries and weekly markets.\nBy car, Québlen is 1 hr 45 minutes from Rennes Airport, 2 hrs from Nantes International Airport, 1hr 20 minutes from Brest aiport, 40 minutes from Quimper airport, and 30 minutes from Lorient airport. \nYou can travel via train (TGV) directly from Paris Montparnasse to Quimperlé (3hrs 10mins) or Lorient (2hrs 50mins). Quimperlé is a 5 minute drive and Lorient is a 30 minute drive from Québlen.\nAlternatively, the ferry ports of Roscoff (less than 2 hours drive) and St Malo (2.5 hours drive) are served by Brittany Ferries with regular departures from both Portsmouth, Plymouth and Cork.",
    "interaction": "Our Housekeeper will greet you on arrival. If you need anything,  she can be contacted.",
    "house_rules": "After 11pm, we request noise is kept to a minimum if seated outside.\nQuéblen is a very old home, please treat it and its contents with respect. Thank you.",

We are interested in the unusual and unconventional. In return, we offer our unique vacation home in the last wilderness of Europe - the Highlands of Scotland.

Also, if you’re a Harry Potter fan and jsut want to feel like you’re at Hogwarts, then stop reading this and go ahead and book this place. My family of four and my parents stayed very comfortably in this flat, and we had a magical time. Between taking in the Loch Ness cruise and the history of the area, as well as our kids pretending to be Hogwarts wizards in training, this stay truly made the whole vacation!",

The common areas are all musky and stagnant. The rugs and flooring show signs and smell of mold. \n\nThe living space is as pictured. The cutlery, linens, bedding, mattresses, and sofa are fitting of a Premiere Inn. The owner’s must have gone to the local Poundland to outfit the space. Poorest quality flatware and insufficient number of glasses. The heating was barely adequate for a cool summer night. The radiator in the master bedroom doesn’t work. I can’t imagine spending a winter holiday there. The rugs in the apartment are old, dingy, and flea infested. All of us received several flea bites during our dreadful stay. \n\nFor the luxury mark up this place is charging, it is a Terrible Value. I paid over £550 per night to stay in an unkept, poorly maintained AirBnB. \n\nReview left by a Marriott Platinum & Hilton Diamond member.",

    "summary": "The Highland Club is set within 20 acres of beautifully landscaped grounds on the shores of Loch Ness. It occupies the Grade A gothic buildings of the original 1729 English fortification, Fort Augustus. 5 Star luxury in a traditional Highland town!",
    "space": "Luxury three bedroom, two bathroom second floor apartment in a landmark grade A listed Benedictine Monastery (The Highland Club) set in 20 acres of private grounds on the shores of Loch Ness. In the heart of the Highlands, this sympathetic conversion is an ideal base for exploring all that Scotland has to offer. Whether you are searching for outdoor adventure, or simply just want to unwind, this is the place to do it.\n\nThis spacious mezzanine apartment has been fitted to the highest specification. Tastefully decorated by Scottish interior design team ANTA coupled with stylish funishings and high specification fittings promise to make your stay both memorable and relaxing. There are a plethora of original features such as the majestic cathedral window in the open plan living area. This beautiful window floods the room with light with wonderful views over the cloisters. As a guest you will have access to all The Highland Club has to offer.\n\nThere is highspeed internet and wifi within the apartment. Two TVs - 50 inch in lounge, and 32 inch in master bedroom.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: \n1. Access is via stairs (52 steps) and there is no elevator. Our property is not suitable for people with limited mobility.\n\n2. The mezzanine bedroom with cannonball bed overlooks the main living area. It is not protected from sound or light. It has a half wall and is not suitable for young children\n\n3. The on site amenities are subject to availability and reserved through a booking system which our agents will guide you to. The pool is limited to 10 people at any one time. During peak periods it does get booked up very quickly.\n\n4. All rooms have UK regulation fire doors by law. They are heavy and make a noise when closing. They are also more difficult for very young children to open. But they have been installed for the safety of all guests.",
    "access": "Facilities included are The Boathouse Restaurant providing an idyllic setting on the shores of Loch Ness in which you can enjoy delicious, locally sourced food. The Highland Club swimming pool, sauna and steam room. Within the stunning grounds outdoor picnic tables and BBQ'S are provided for guest use; tennis court, outdoor table tennis, croquet lawn, giant chess and children’s adventure play area promise to keep everyone amused.

The pool is limited to 10 people at any one time. During peak periods it does get booked up very quickly.",
    "notes": "There are a couple of local grocery stores in the village. If you are arriving from Inverness it is worth stopping at the Tesco Extra Superstore to stock up on provisions. It is open 24 four hours a day, 7 days a week\n\nCLEANING CHARGE: We are often asked about the amount of this charge. It is exactly what we pay our local managing agent and simply pass it on. It covers a full clean, linen changeover and meet and greet of all guests (plus Sales tax!)",
    "neighborhood": "The Highland Club is situated in the picturesque village of Fort Augustus which lies south-west of Loch Ness near the Caledonian Canal. Like any good village, there are a full selection of local amenities, including pubs, shops and restaurants.\n\nWhether you’re into water sports, boating or spotting Nessie herself, the world famous Loch Ness will not disappoint. At 23 miles long, it is one of the longest and deepest lochs in Scotland. The character of the loch is undoubtedly awe-inspiring and varied given its size; so the view from the shifting banks changes dramatically as you travel through. With Inverness at the top, and Drumnadrochit to the west, the loch is connected by the surrounding A28 main road, allowing you to visit all of the key spots along the way.\n\nFor the active amongst you, in good weather, the loch is the perfect platform to take to boating activities. If youre a novice, the Highland Club will steer you in the right direction for the appropriate guidance.",
    "transit": "Fort Augustus is equidistant to Inverness (to the north) and Fort William (to the south), and an hour's drive from either. The Caledonian Sleeper train from London stops at both stations. The nearest airport is Inverness. \n\nIt is highly recommended that you hire a car for your stay to truly enjoy the Highlands. Hire cars are easily booked at Fort William or Inverness",

Very design chic, beautifully maintained, peaceful & welcoming atmosphere. It truly was a grand mansion that had been lovingly restored, with its original oil paintings. \n\nYou can tell this house is family owned as there are abundant thoughtful touches throughout. Our children loved the constant supply of complimentary lemon sherbets in a big bowl on the way in/ out of the building. They loved the full sized pool table too under the stairwell.\n\nEvery apartment seems to offer a different feel. We’ve already booked again for next year after leaving today. \n\nThe location is superb, an easy 5 min walk into Ulverston. \n\nWe were greeted by quirky live street music on Saturday morning in the village. Such a pretty little place with wonderful eateries & pubs. Ulverston is not as overrun as the other well known villages like Bowness, Ambleside etc.",

Everything about the flat was spacious and luxurious, and we loved the extra touches like bubble bath, coffee, and some breakfast essentials. The beds are just fantastic, and those deserve a mention of their own 😁! This is a such a beautiful and culturally significant area of Scotland, so we enjoyed walking, hiking, and driving to explore all of it. In particular, Karen’s website/portal was deeply appreciated and super helpful - a true gem at helping us to lay out an itinerary. I recommend this place to anyone looking for a relaxing and beautiful stay in the Scottish countryside - it really delivers!",

I am extremely grateful that Debra allowed me and my wife to create such beautiful memories and reconnect in her home. \nThe sheer presence of the castle in person is jaw dropping. The courtyard and the design of the home give off such tranquil vibes . The setting of the home takes you to a different time period where the things that matter aren't electronic devices but the people you are there with. \n\nThe heated spa was absolutely amazing and exactly what was needed while we were on our retreat. There home's Soundsystem ( the sound system is exquisite! A+ for the sound system ) has a speaker  spa/poolside which adds to the ambiance and allure to that setting.  Just imagine the heated spa, your favorite tunes and the warm vibes of a fire pit all at the same time...😁\n\nThe inside of the home is just as exquisite  as the out. There is so much detail in the home and you can really tell that gave careful thought to it's design and layout. \nThe oversized shower also can double as a steam room!! It's unreal how beautiful this home is.\n\nPrior to reserving, Debra communicated that she would be onsite was onsite  however in a completely separate section/location of the home . She advised that we would only share a carport and a common walkway from the carport.  Her transparency about her being onsite allowed me  to make a decision on whether or not I wanted to book. I really appreciated that. (To add , we had complete privacy . We saw Debra for the initial home tour and that was it ) \nThe communication was excellent. The personality was very welcoming. When I had questions regarding places to eat, she not only   provided me with a listing of suggested restaurants,  she pulled some strings to get us the best seats in the house @firefly.  \nThe wine and snacks were a pleasant welcoming gift too ☺️\nDebra is the kind of host that I would most definitely love to do business with in the future. Me and my wife will forever share fond memories of our first time to California.\nThank you Debra for sharing your home with us.",

    "summary": "Entire upstairs in this historic, iconic 1931 castle includes kitchen, living room, exclusive gardens, courtyards, pool & spa. Tucked high up in the legendary Laurel Canyon, this just restored 2 bed/1 bath private suite embodies Hollywood's golden age with 21st Century comforts. Quiet and serene, surrounded by ancient oaks and flowering bougainvillea, yet minutes from bustling Sunset Strip, West Hollywood and Studio City, this property is a rare example of 1920s filmic storybook architecture.",
    "space": "*** Please note: 4-day maximum booking from May 26-September 4.\n*** Additional guests not noted in the reservation will be charged an additional $150/night.\n\nThe upstairs suite in this magical newly restored gated home includes full kitchen, living room, master and guest bedroom, marble bathroom and steam shower for two, claw foot bath tub, two fireplaces, private courtyard off one side of the master, and deck overlooking pool on the other. Very private, quiet, safe and exclusive! \n\nWith its long history, every inch of the suite oozes character, patina and detail rarely seen in modern homes. The master bedroom is a stroke of romantic genius reminiscent of a far away outpost from ancient times. Think gothic doorways and leaded glass windows in a circular room with an enormous rotunda ceiling (and yes, a smart tv).\n\nFrom the master, step into the private stone courtyard and imagine you are in a Spanish castle built by Gaudi. \n\nAdjacent to the master is the guest bedroom, which can accommodate twin, full, queen or a king sized bed. \n\nBoth bedrooms open to the vestibule with its groin vault ceiling and round gold leaf skylight, which leads to the sumptuous bathroom as well as the deck overlooking the pool for outdoor lounging and dining. \n\nServing both the master and guest bedroom, the bathroom is for highly discriminating clientele desiring an experience reminiscent of a Turkish spa. Unwind in this architecturally elaborate Morroccan-inspired chamber powered by two steam jets and equipped with his-and-her shower heads, chromotherapy lighting, marble slab for reposing, rain head and built-in audio speaker. \n\nFlowing seamlessly from the vestibule through the interior gothic rock archway is the kitchen and banquette…and then onto the living room,  where you surrender yourself to the royal surroundings of a fantastic gothic room modeled after sets of European castles featured in films in the 1920s and early 30s (specifically, Boris Karloff's castle in the original black and white \"Frankenstein\" film).\n\nThe back living room door leads past a wishing well to the tunnel, through which you walk to a moat over the swimming pool. From here, you can slip into the gated pool area and play a game of ping pong, forget it all in the spa or chill in the hammock by the fire pit. \n\nLighting details throughout the suite are exquisite, with chandeliers, hand-blown glass pendants, crystal sconces, natural fiber shades, up lighting, pin spots and swing arm lamps, all setting the mood for warm, glowing ambience. No stark overhead airport landing strips of recessed led lights in this house.\n\nThis historic residence, at once luxurious and unique, is one of the oldest homes in the Lookout Mountain section of Laurel Canyon. It is ideally situated to provide a peaceful respite from the sprawling city below yet fantastically well situated in the Hollywood Hills. You won't be able to find such a unique, high-end accommodation like this in Los Angeles (or the world), and certainly not for less than the cost of a one-bedroom pool suite in a comparable old Hollywood hotel. It is truly one of a kind. \n\nCalling all writers, artists and romantics seeking a space in which to work and relax, this filmic castle in the canyon is a storybook set waiting for someone to inspire.\n\nWalk 3 minutes to the best ocean-to-city view in town or drive 3 minutes to one of the best networks of hiking trails the city has to offer.\n\nMinutes by car from either Studio City, Universal City, The Sunset Strip, West Hollywood, Hollywood and Beverly Hills. If headed to the beach, Sunset Plaza Drive connects to Sunset Blvd, which winds through posh neighborhoods and ends directly at Pacific Coast Highway. Very centrally located. Many fine restaurants and cultural points of interest in areas easily reachable by rental car or Uber.\n\nWeekly maid, garden and pool service provided. \n\nCommunications:  Flat screen tv (Netflix, local channels and HBO…more cable channels available upon demand) in master bedroom, plus turbo wifi, and built-in Sonos sound system. Wireless booster for the pool area, and several inside/outside areas can serve as work stations. \n\nWe keep a completely separate and private downstairs studio for use by either one of our family members unless you are renting the entire property, which includes both the upstairs and the downstairs suite.\n\nSpa heats up in 15-20 minutes and costs $15 per use. Pool heat requires at least two days advance notice and costs an extra $60 per day.",
    "access": "This is a gated property. When you book, you will be provided specific property directions and access instructions. \n\nOff-street tandem parking for two cars is available inside the carport and driveway. \n\nFrom the carport, walk up the first and second flight of stairs. The doors will be left unlocked for you to enter and enjoy. Basic amenities are provided, including starter supply of soap and shampoo, paper products, and hotel-quality linens and towels.\n\nAccess the private pool, spa and fire pit area through the gothic gate at the end of the wide stone pathway. Enjoy the garden. Pick the fruit in season.",
    "notes": "Our 20-year-old son, a college student, is helping manage our property. Don't be surprised if he answers your calls or email.\n\nThe entire house is on filtered water, so drinking and showering is free of chlorine and other impurities. The kitchen comes equipped with a Miele combination steam-convection oven rather than a microwave.\n\nEven though we're in the middle of the city, cellular service is sketchy in the hills. However, we have excellent wifi throughout the house for Wifi assisted cellular calls and a TMobile booster. If all else fails, we have  a back-up landline for domestic calls.\n\nRemodeled guest bedroom not shown in photos.",
    "neighborhood": "Charming homes surrounded by ancient oak trees are tucked into soaring canyon walls of green, providing a sense of privacy, quiet and seclusion in the city's coastal green belt known as the Santa Monica Mountain range. And yet, within a 3-minute walk from the house is a vast view of twinkling lights from the amazing city at night and the endless blue ribbon of the Pacific Ocean on the horizon during the day. Also minutes from one of the best network of hiking trails in the city, and located in the esteemed Wonderland school district.\n\nFor those who seek to glimpse the way Laurel Canyon used to be in its early days, this is the neighborhood. It is still quaint and reflective of its original character.",
    "transit": "Even though Laurel Canyon is ideally close to Hollywood, West Hollywood, Studio City and the major studios, the property is located in the hills above the city. A car or Uber (please tip the driver) is recommended for quick and easy city access. \n\nThe Saturday Night Live skit, \"The Californians,\" is no joke. Angelinos get in heated debates about the best ways to circumnavigate the city's notorious traffic to get to desired locations. For those unfamiliar with the city (or even if you think you know it like the back side of your hand), we'll do our best to provide you with what we consider the most desirable routes. \n\nTo access areas impacted by major traffic and expensive parking (such as Downtown Los Angeles), you can easily drive to the Universal City/Studio City Metro station (where there is generally free parking to be found before 7:30 weekdays) and from there explore the city using public transit. Alternatively, if you are in good shape you can walk  to the intersection of Lookout Mountain and Laurel Canyon, where a bus stops hourly.\n\nIf you don't feel like messing with the city and its traffic, just put on a pair of sneakers and explore the neighborhood on foot. Some of the most breathtaking views in all of Los Angeles are here, and also fun little narrow roads and plenty of hills for a vigorous workout.\n\nThe closest coffee joint and market is our beloved Canyon Country Store (a genuine throw-back to the rock and roll era of the '60s and '70s for which Laurel Canyon is world renown) on the corner of Laurel Canyon Blvd and Kirkwood. This is a great place to soak up the vibe of the hood. Of equal impressive Laurel Canyon vibey-ness is the most excellent Pace restaurant, located downstairs from the market. (If you don't want to motor or Uber down to Pace's, they deliver in the canyon!)",

The hosts, Jonathan and Karen, greeted us when we arrived and they were so accommodating throughout our whole stay. We enjoyed every part of the castle from the beautiful decor, rooms, outdoor hangout areas, forest walk, deer farm, and more! We spent a couple days there, but we made sure to make time for one full day at the castle to enjoy everything from the incredible Irish breakfast with fresh ingredients from their farm (this was an add-on to our stay and I highly recommend this), walks in the forest trail, playing games on their lawn, enjoying their hot tub and fire pits under the stars, enjoying some drinks in the pub, and more! It was truly such a MAGICAL experience and we are so grateful for the hospitality, kindness, and incredible castle. Everything exceeded our expectations and we will always cherish the memories made from our wonderful stay at Springfield Castle! Thank you so much to the hosts again!",

    "space": "The East Tower is situated in the heart of County Limerick on a magical 200 acre wooded estate and is approached along a magnificent three quarter mile long avenue, lined with ancient lime trees. Springfield is a family owned business run by Jonathan and Betty. Betty's brother Robert and his wife Rita, Lord and Lady Muskerry live in South Africa but visit at least once a year as Robert has a keen interest in his family home and its restoration. The estate includes beautiful woodlands and an organic working deer farm and Jonathan will be more than happy to take you to meet the deer. It is a historic castle where many battles were fought and for those who are interested Betty will share her wealth of knowledge and give you a tour of the 15th Century Tower house adjacent to the East Tower .There are also woodland walks, with barbeque areas, and lots of lovely outdoor spaces. The East tower has open plan shared spaces with a lovely long sitting room and a very quaint pub,which we can stock with barrels of Heineken and Guinness for you. While you can cater for yourself while staying in the Castle we can arrange a chef to come in and cater for breakfasts, lunches and dinners if required. We produce a lot of fruit and vegetables in our chemical free walled garden and this produce is available for guests to buy. If you decide to enjoy a meal while staying the chef will use as much of the fresh produce from the garden as possible.",
    "access": "When you rent Springfield's East Tower it is exclusively yours. There are forest walks, a tennis court, a pool table, table tennis, table football ,darts, croquet, boules, badminton and   a pub which we can stock with barrels of Heineken and Guinness for you.There is a courtyard with a fountain,  a soccer pitch, archery, BBQ areas, a bonfire pit and much more.",

The Tower is also well based for touring all of the south west and we can help you to plan day trips.",

At the end of the weekend my partner said she couldn't have had a better birthday.\n\nThe Bridge House and Bridge Cottage are beautiful, characterful properties which we hired together giving us a big place to relax and enjoy ourselves. We tend towards quirky places and this was the quirkiest yet. A look through the visitor book tells you how much previous guests have enjoyed it, too. The only problem with our stay was it wasn't long enough. This place is booked solid for a reason.\n\nMirian was very easy to deal with. Her communication was always prompt and couldn't be faulted. We look forward to seeing her next time we get the opportunity to stay there.",

The is a veranda seating area on one side and a small sauna in a quirky stone out-building on the other.\n\nThe upper bridge house has a romantic  master bedroom with kingsize four poster bed and great views downriver.\n\nThe second little bedroom also has a small double bed, pretty views up river views and 'en-suite' privy direct into the river below (no longer in service!)\n\nBoth bedrooms share a bathroom with bath/shower.\n\nThere is also a connecting sitting room / mini second kitchen with log stove. \n(The bridge house can also be rented as two separate 2 bedroom self contained units - see other listings.)\n\nIf you're lucky with the weather you can enjoy the garden and river.

Airconditioning was on when we entered the place (which was nice) from 109 degrees outside. When we parked up the driveway, it was a bit confusing of where we were to enter into the building. We finally found it along a sidewalk towards the front area of the property, arrows to guide probably would be needed. \n\nEvery morning we were woken up by construction hammering/banging upstairs. We loved the antiques all around the entire place. We had NO TV access!! No remote for the main room and remote in the bedroom batteries were dead. Someone did drop off some batteries but it was too late. Owners were out of town so the response time was off. However we made it work by watching our cell phones. \n\nIt was a Very Beautiful place however, spending that kind of money for what we got (on this special trip), we probably will not book here again.",

I had a wonderful time there. The only reason I gave it a four star rating for overall experience was that the bed was not comfortable at all . I will just say we did not sleep hardly at all due to the mattress for 3 days. You need to upgrade this mattress as soon as possible .Besides that, I had a wonderful time. Thank you.",

Stepping up to the amazing front door, I couldn’t wait to go inside. The decor was totally gorgeous. Especially, the sofa & chair and the large ceiling light. Everything in every room and every level I was inspired by all of the beautiful furniture and decor. It couldn’t have had anything nicer. It was so very peaceful & serene. I will definitely come back again sometime. I have to say that Tyler, David and Sarah have something very “SPECIAL”. They were also so very Pleasant and Caring. They are great people.",

There's a player piano that I had to figure out how to use, but it was so awesome! I love history and historical places, so instead of dragging my partner to German Village and historic places to tour, we stayed here! It's remodeled, obviously, but it's still so charming. It has all of the modern features you need and all of the history and beauty you'd expect. There's an arcade system with old games in the basement, which we spent so much time playing! \n\nIf you're wanting to stay in German Village, this is the place. There are so many great restaurants, bakeries/coffee shops, shops, etc around this place. The Book Loft is a five minute walk, and if you need to drive to another area, the location is really convenient for getting on the interstate.\n\nI wouldn't hesitate to book again! Thank you so much for the experience!",

  "description": {
    "summary": "Bickleigh Castle is a fine Grade 1 listed property comprising the ancient Keep, Saxon Chapel, picturesque thatched cottages and some 60 acres with the River Exe running through it.  \n\nOur delightful castle bedroom and cottage bedrooms  include spectacular views and comfortable beds . With exclusive use of the Castle and grounds, why not make our Castle your home for 2 days to 2 months!\n\nNightly price is for 16 self-catering (max settable). We can sleep up to 40 but the price will be higher.",
    "space": "Located in the beautiful Devon countryside with a fine stretch of the River Exe running through the grounds, Bickleigh Castle is the perfect retreat for all seasons.\nIf you are looking for a peaceful, restful or romantic break, you have come to the right place. You can have a self-catering weekend.\n\nThe picturesque location has inspired many a writer, poet, artist and historian and it really does take you away from everything. \n\nWith acres of gardens and grounds to roam, a 'secret garden' with an orchard and pond, a moat plus a beautiful chapel and Castle, there is plenty of space for you to explore. We also have an excellent hard Tennis Court, and plenty of space for an informal game of cricket or football.  For a relaxing end to the day, why not jump into our Hot Tub and relax with the bird song and wildlife all around?\n \nWe are very conveniently located just 20 minutes from Exeter and Crediton and only 10 minutes from Tiverton. We are easily reached from Tiverton Parkway and Exeter St Davids Railway Stations.\n\n\"Some came to soak up the grandeur and exclusivity of Bickleigh Castle, and others for its warmth and intimacy. Whatever the reason, each guest is guaranteed the most perfect stay \"",
    "access": "All guest areas can be accessed, including the gardens, grounds and recreational facilities and the various Reception rooms in the Castle and other areas. There are, however, a few private areas which may not be used. \n\nGuests booking through Airbnb will have exclusive use of the estate with the exception of the private areas; the estate will not be open to the public during a private exclusive use booking.\n\nThere is a very large amount of free parking, and, by arrangement, some garage space can be made available for special vehicles such as Classics.",
    "notes": "VERY IMPORTANT NOTE:  The listing is for 16 people but we can accommodate up to 40 ;  the amount quoted is ONLY for 16 people therefore, and any additional people are charged on a per head basis.  Furthermore, the quoted price is for self-catering. We can, however, provide full or part hotel services if required, at additional cost.",
    "neighborhood": "Bickleigh Castle is in a particularly beautiful and unspoilt area of the Exe Valley, yet only 8 miles from Exeter, 4 miles from Tiverton, 9 miles from the M5 (Junction 27) and 30 mins drive from Exeter Airport.  The Exe Valley may shortly be designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. There is an excellent range of eating places in the area.",
    "transit": "It is probably best to come by car, or hire a minibus for the duration. However, if coming by public transport, there are good train services to Tiverton (2 hrs from London)and Exeter St Davids, and frequent bus services.  The area of the Castle is suitable for walking, cycling, and kayaking on our river. For fishing you require proper equipment and clothing. We can arrange for you horse riding and clay pigeon shooting.",
    "interaction": "We will keep as high or low a profile as required. Usually we lay on some degree of hosting.  Staff, as mentioned elsewhere, are available.",

Quel plaisir de se prélasser dans le spa ou de disputer quelques parties de tennis en sirotant un gin dans les chaises Adirondack.  Le lieu est un personnage en soi, une maison pleine de caractère ! Nous avons beaucoup apprécié finir les soirées au salon du grenier.  De plus, malgré la déco à l'ancienne, tout le luxe moderne s'y trouve, du lave-vaisselle aux surmatelas en mousse-mémoire.\n\nAvis aux amateurs de vélo : il y a de superbes circuits de gravel bike à faire dans le secteur, si le dénivelé ne vous effraie pas trop.\n\nVincent est un hôte généreux et attentif, nous n'avons manqué de rien !  Nous envisageons déjà un prochain séjour !",

The castle is 15th century rustic, yet has a refined elegance that it a tribute to the wonderful restoration and interior design that was performed extremely well. My family of 5 had more room than we could have ever imagined. The kitchen was used to make one of the best dinners during our stay in Ireland. The dining room was lovely then we retired to the great room upstairs to enjoy playing cards next to the fire with wine and Irish whiskey. It has everything you need for a peaceful, once in a life time, castle experience.",

So beautiful and peaceful. The castle is quite large as far as rooms and all go. We are a family of four and had more than enough room and could have had a few more join us and not felt cramped. Very spacious. Oh, and it’s a castle! It has been remodeled to be sure you have all the comforts you need while still being in a legit castle setting. Loved it! There are a lot of stairs to get to the rooms and it is a tighter spiral staircase. But again, it’s a castle! But those with mobility issues would have some challenges as all the bedrooms are up the stairs. That is not a negative on this place at all, just information. We all loved it… especially the kids (15 and 12). Highly recommend!",

The 75 stone steps were great fun (and a good workout), though would be challenging with very little kids or folks with limited mobility.  A high highlight of our trip to Ireland!",

    "summary": "Built in the late 1400s, Grantstown Castle has been lovingly restored and mixes medieval architecture with modern comforts. The Castle Is Rented In Its Entirety And Caters For Up To Seven Guests. The castle is comprised of six floors, connected via a stone and oak spiral staircase. There are three double bedrooms and one single. The castle has great battlements which are accessible at the top of the staircase and host amazing views of the surrounding countryside.",
    "space": "The castle is located in a rural farming area with stunning views of the surrounding countryside. It’s quiet and peaceful and perfect for relaxing. There are 3 double bedrooms, one with an en suite half bathroom. The fourth bedroom, which is very unique, is a small single room. Besides the en suite half bathroom, there are two full bathrooms (one with a bath, one shower), and one other half bathroom. The “Great Room” which was traditionally used for entertaining is the largest room with a beautifully hand built stone fireplace. Look up from the Great Room to see the Minstrels Gallery. Feel free to go up and serenade your loved ones! There’s a large table in the Great Room perfect for playing games! There are playing cards and some games available. There is a modest but functional kitchen on the bottom floor. The kitchen has a stove top, oven and microwave for cooking and has a stock of tea, coffee and hot chocolate. \n\nGrantstown castle was built during the first part of the 'Tudor' period. It is thought that the building date could be as early as 1480 but it was certainly in existence during the  reign of Henry VIII. The first documented evidence is found in the much cited \"Ormond Deeds\" of 1549, when the castle was owned by the very prominent 'de Burgos' family.\nWe have left a printed comprehensive history of the castle in a black folder in the Great room.\n\nThere are two prisons (oubliettes) within the walls of the castle, access to one of these (in the Great Room) is covered with reinforced glass which allows the room to be viewed. The light switch is behind you when looking down, behind the bench. Please turn off light switch after viewing.\nThe original entrance to the other prison is covered with a stout timber hatch, that can be seen when climbing the stairs.\n\nThe rooms in the castle are accessed by a spiral staircase, 72 steps to the first level of battlements. The staircase is well lit 24 hours a day, but is not for the faint of heart, or those who find stairs at all difficult.",
    "access": "Guests will have full use of the castle in its entirety.\n\nThe castle can accommodate a maximum of seven people as there are three beautiful double bedrooms and a very unique small single room. \nAbsolutely NO additional guests allowed IN the castle. Only the guests booked in to stay are permitted inside. Anyone found to be breaking this rule will be asked to leave immediately. \n\nWhilst every effort has been made to make the castle safe, please be aware that some doorways are rather low, and the staircase has very high steps, is narrow and tricky and not accessible for the less-abled or small children. Children should be accompanied by an adult at all times on the staircase. Please take care, we want everyone to have the most enjoyable experience when they visit.",
    "notes": "Check in time is 4pm, check out 11am.\n\nNo smoking allowed anywhere in the castle, including out on the roof. \n\nWe do have Wi-Fi on site, however it is not 100% dependable in the castle due to the thick walls. \n\nWe live in one of the small cabins beside the castle (the middle one!). If we are here we would love to meet you and you’re free to call in if you need anything at all. If we are not there and you need anything we are just a phone call/message/email away, don’t hesitate to contact us.\n\nGrantstown Castle is a very old stone building built in the late 1400s. There are a few ancestors of the original inhabitants still here today…. Spiders! We make every effort to remove them from the castle, but it’s impossible to keep them out, so you may see the odd spider or some webs, despite our best efforts and constant cleaning. It’s just how it is in a castle!! \n\nThe castle is a large old stone building with walls as thick as 6-7’ on the lower levels. Therefore, it maintains a slightly cooler temperature. The castle has underfloor heating. Many people are surprised how warm it is inside! The thermostats are set to keep a constant comfortable temperature. But this will not be like Room temperature in a house. If the temperature outside drops, it can take the underfloor heating at least a day or two to catch up so it may be a little cooler.\n\nIn the winter months, when it's wet outside, the small single bedroom can get damp. We do have another comfortable fold up single bed on the \"Minstrel's Gallery\" that can be used instead if necessary.  \n\nThere are towels available for use.",
    "neighborhood": "Grantstown Castle is in the middle of one of the two arms of the Golden Vale. The farmland in the area is amongst the best in Ireland and is largely used for dairying in this area but is more mixed wider afield. \nSix mountain ranges can be seen from the battlements on most days. The largest of these are the Galtee mountains . Further south and 'behind' the Galtees are the Knockmealdowns, The Comeragh mountains to the South East, Slievenamon to the East, the Devil's Bit to the North East and the tips of the Silvermines due north.",
    "transit": "The castle is located on a very quiet road. It’s narrow , so take care driving in! \nIt’s a lovely area to go out for a walk. You can stroll along the country roads or travel a bit further for some hiking in the nearby mountains. \nIt’s just a short drive to the towns of Cashel and Tipperary. You will find everything you need in both of these towns, shopping, restaurants and traditional Irish pubs.",
    "interaction": "You can walk down into the “Quarry” from which the stone was taken from to build the castle. To access the Quarry, walk to the back of the property (past the three cabins), and go through the small black gate to the right. There is a beautiful arboretum to enjoy with a glorious view of the castle. The property line is the driveway of the cottage.",
    "house_rules": "Check in 4pm, check out 11am. \nWe kindly ask that guests keep the castle clean and tidy. Do not leave any excess garbage outside of the waste bins or dirty dishes outside of the dishwasher. Any additional cleaning required will be charged for.\nStrictly no parties, gatherings or events. \nAbsolutely NO additional guests allowed IN the castle. Only the guests booked in to stay are permitted inside. Anyone found to be breaking this rule will have their reservation cancelled and be asked to leave immediately. \nWeapons on display must not be removed from the wall. \nAbsolutely no smoking inside or out on the roof. Any evidence of smoking will result in an additional cleaning fee. \nNo eating or drinking (besides water) in the bedrooms. \nDo not open any windows. \nKeep all doors closed.",

The directions were great. The house itself is lovely. We opted to cater ourselves and the kitchen was easy to navigate with essentials provided (oil, tea, coffee, etc). Everyone commented on how much they liked the house. I would definitely recommend staying here. I just need an excuse to come back!",

He was always on hand if we needed anything and would reply to any requests immediately. With help from Tommy they cooked us a nice meal on the Saturday evening and did all the dishes and cleaning up afterwards, which was lovely. \n\nWe especially loved the bar area and open fires in the lounge and dining rooms. \n\nThe bedding and bedrooms were clean. They have recently decorated 2 of the bedrooms and put in 2 new en-suites. If they carry on doing this in all of the other bedrooms it will improve their standard from good to very good.\n\nThis ex hotel house is perfect for a large family get together. \n\nThanks again Andrew for being such a welcoming host and Nick for good communication before our arrival with pre plans and visit.",

We strongly believe that the first steps towards spectacular hospitality is taking care of our team and environments. Here, you'll meet the incredible Dunskey stewards who sincerely wish to share with you the joy, beauty, and warmth in all that we do. Most significantly, you will find extraordinary thoughtfulness in every moment of your journey here. \n\nWe are also a feministic company with a laser focus on sustainability. We use re-fillable products wherever possible. Our heating system is nearly at 100% sourced from renewable energy. We compost 100% of our food waste, and our water comes from a fresh spring. We continuously strive to do more and do better.\n\nOur ongoing other projects include policy advocacy in immigration and anti-human trafficking, working on turning out the votes in America and fighting against voter suppression laws. Seeking social and racial justice is a constant, though sometimes painful, anchor in our lives. We would like everyone to read the two novels, The Overstory, by Richard Powers, and, Ministry for the Future by Kim Stanley Robinson. When not heartened by the possibility of collective action to address climate change, we like to cook a ton-load of Vietnamese beef noodle soup and plot the next magic mushroom trail on the Estate.

    "summary": "Wake up to sights of cranes gliding across the rolling hills that stretch to the ocean. The world beckons outside your window at the Velvet Upperground, the penthouse apartment inside Dunskey Castle. Scottish mist may linger nearby, evoking lyrics by the Velvet Underground, \"I've been set free and I've been bound / To the memories of yesterday's clouds.\" Lavish interiors, two oversized-bedrooms with ensuite bathrooms, and underfloor heating ensures you will be soon floating on cloud nine.",
    "space": "Established by a dapper industry magnate and Member of Parliament Charles Lindsay Orr Ewing, Dunskey Castle infuses intelligent luxury and historical romance into every second of your spectacular stay. The Castle, completed at the turn of the century, showcases unrivaled technology of its heyday and historical architecture of enormous proportions. \n\nEnter the Velvet Upperground through your own private entrance at the Castle's East Wing door. Take your exclusive elevator to the top floor of the Castle and open directly into the most surprising space. Throughout this penthouse apartment, physical features will bring alive the patriarch's globetrotting influences and the rich history of Scottish merchants at the cusp of the Industrial Revolution.The incredibly spacious corridor showcases one of the few lightwells in the Castle, where diffused sunlight is gorgeously diffused. Here, you'll find one of the original cast-iron bathtubs from the Castle, now filled with plants, with salvaged mirrors that cover one entire wall. \n\nThe open-plan living area features two commanding floor-to-ceiling bay windows with built-in seats. From here you'll have the most magnificent view of the tranquil fields, the idyllic Portpatrick village in the distance, and of course, the wide stretch of the ocean. Lounge on cream linen three-seater sofas, or cozy up with a book on the curved velvet fainting couch, in front of the art-deco gold coffee table, with a glossy golden silk-and-wool rug to cushion your feet. A mural of trailing vines hangs on the main living room wall, bringing inside hints of the Estate's botanical wonders. \nCook up the most gourmet meals inside this modern kitchen, featuring a state-of-the-art induction precision-cooking stove top. Meal preparation is made easy with the artisan butcher-block work surface and the breakfast bar, where your friends can perch on mustard velvet grommet stools with a glass of bubble in hand. \n\nThe piece-de-resistance, of course, is the master suite called Sojourner Truth at the Velvet Upperground. An outrageously oversized room that seems to flood with lights even on overcast days, this bedroom is truly one of the most incredible spaces in the Castle. One of our most treasured beds is here: a cream lacquered canopy bed, hand-cut to follow the designs of stained-glass-windows, will ensure the most wondrous slumber. The room is also designed to evoke a sense of a conservatory, showcasing window-pane mirrors, oversized prints from glasshouses, and botanicals in muted shades of green and gray. One of the best features of this suite is the built-in bathtub, allowing you to have the most relaxing soak with heavenly views over your shoulders. The original Baronial fireplace with its hand-glazed burnt-amber tiles is also here, flanked by mid-century armchairs sourced from an antique market in Vietnam. \n\nThe second bedroom, named after Rosa Parks, is a golden retreat. Here, you'll find a lovely grommet velvet bed in the color of sunshine. A mirror chest of drawers adds a touch glamour to the bedroom. Boudoir-style curved dressing table with its vintage table mirror is a welcome spot for writing home that postcard about Dunskey. Green velvet armchairs by the window invite you to linger for more reading and less doomscrolling. The bedroom, of course, comes with ensuite bathroom with a whimsical French-shutter window into the suite, and large amount of space for storage.",

    "neighborhood": "You're not simply staying in a Castle Estate: you are staying on one of the most beautiful spots on the planet. Dunskey Estate boasts two waterfalls, two lochs, and three beaches, with the most magnificent walks along the craggy Scottish coastline. This pleasure ground will be completely yours to explored, including a private walled garden and a maze. You will have the time of your life, I promise.\n\nThe walled garden with its glass house is a romantic and peaceful retreat on the estate. Two lochs nestle into the hills and rhododendron banks. Wander along the glen walk past a rushing waterfall, and a babbling brook, to the two beaches to spot dolphins and seals. Dunskey Golf Course and the picturesque Portpatrick Harbour is two minutes away. Fishing expeditions from the beaches or on our two lochs are available. \n\nPortpatrick Village has a public tennis court, putting green, golf course, beaches, and many restaurants.

It was right next to the boat tours and the little restaurant was lovely. The canal was pretty awesome too (my engineer husband had a field day). Drove all around Loch Ness and David’s place was definitely an incredible and unique way to see the Loch!",

Ground Floor:\nOpen plan living space: With beams and flagstone floor.\nLiving area: With wood burner, TV and DVD player.\nDining area.\nKitchen area: With cooker, microwave, fridge and washer/dryer.\nTurning stairs to...\nBathroom: With shower over deep slipper bath, and toilet.\nTurning stairs to...\nBedroom: With four poster double bed.. LPG central heating, electricity, bed linen, towels and Wi-Fi included. Initial logs for wood burner included, remainder available locally. Grassed area with garden furniture. Private parking for 1 car. No smoking.. The romantic retreat of Hen Wrych Hall Tower features a heavily carved king-size four poster bed, Victorian style bathroom and an open working fireplace. Less than 5 minutes’ walk from the North Wales coastline and beach, and a mile from local pubs, restaurants and shops. It is ideally situated for sightseeing, there is a golf course nearby and walks within local woods and hills. Bodnant Gardens, Conwy and several castles are within short driving distance, and the pretty Victorian seaside resort of Llandudno is easily accessible for the day.\nGrade II* listed, this castellated gate tower is set into the original curtain wall of the Grade I listed Gwrych Castle, and overlooks the 500 year old Hen Wrych Hall, once home to the poet Felicia Hemans, whose famous poem was The Boy Stood on the Burning Deck’.\nDownstairs the cosy living area provides a delightful space for relaxing and a wood-burning stove will be a pleasure to return to in the winter months after a busy days sightseeing. A hand-carved mahogany staircase leads up to the first floor bathroom fitted with a sumptuously deep slipper bath and original Thomas Crapper toilet cistern. The attention to detail continues as you reach the second floor and the master bedroom. Here you will find a spectacular, heavily carved, Elizabethan-style four poster bed, the perfect complement to this romantic retreat.\nGwrych Castle is ranked as one of the most important castellated houses of the picturesque style in Britain. Originally completed around 1822, the castle, its associated towers, lodges and park walls were designed by Lord and Lady Bamford Hesketh and Thomas Rickman, the architect and architectural theorist. The ground floor of the Tower still features one of his original cast iron windows. The wooden front door is also original and traces of scratched pictures of period sailing ships, possibly left by Napoleanic prisoners of war, can still be seen.\nExtensive renovation work was carried out by the present owners in collaboration with the local Conwy conservation officer. Unique features such as the camber headed front doorway and original bread oven have been preserved and a specially commissioned metal window was added to match the Rickman window downstairs. The 2020 series of ’I’m A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here’ was filmed in the estate.\nFree WiFi",

The design of this castle is so cool, especially when you climb the stairs up to the tower at the top of the castle. \n\nPlus the tall ceilings with the giant kitchen, giant dining room with a granite huge dining room table…it’s just awesome! Plus make sure you walk on the trail in the back in the enchanted forest. It’s got such beautiful trees. \n\nNot only was the castle in the sky amazing but the hosts are some of the nicest people I’ve ever met! I can’t say enough about this castle and the people that host it. Book it, you will be impressed with the experience that is like nothing you will have in a normal Airbnb house!",
