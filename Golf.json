The 2-car garage was a plus with a lot of street parking in the front. \n\nOverall Tahmeed & owners were accommodating, able to answer our questions with ease and made sure we were taken cared of throughout our stay.",

We didn't use the  projection TV but it looked really awesome.  The bed was great. Shower, no tub. It is on a dead end street. We were able to park with no problem each night. It is 1.4 miles to the Ballston MU metro. My daughter didn't want to walk so we drove to the Ballston city parking garage each day and parked there. It's a 5-7 min walk to the metro station. There were a lot of bad reviews for that parking garage on-line but I didn't have any problems. I was able to pay with cash one day and credit card two days with no issues. And it was really reasonable. $1 for 2 or 3 hours up to $10 for an entire day. It is a basement apartment so you will get some noise from the floor above periodically. But again, we were out each day all day so it wasn't really an issue for me. Most importantly (to me) - Ginger was extremely responsive.  It was very clean and cheery!",

    "space": "This is a newly constructed, bright, very modern basement apartment with a separate entrance. We've worked to equip the apartment with everything necessary to ensure that you have a comfortable and relaxing stay, including plush linens, a beautiful fully-equipped kitchen, gourmet coffee and tea, snacks, and a projector TV. There is a queen-sized bed in a private bedroom with a large closet and a full-sized futon in the living room. There are a variety of puzzles, books, and board games to entertain.  There is a brand new private patio with a table and chairs if you want to have a glass of wine and relax at the end of the day. We want to make family stays as easy as possible, and are happy to provide baby/toddler necessities free of charge at your request, including a Pack n' Play, infant tub, booster seat/high chair, books, and toys.\n\nIf you want to venture outside, the apartment is just a few blocks from Bluemont park and three of Northern Virginia's best biking/walking trails. \n\nPlease Note: \nThis is a basement apartment and we live upstairs with our two young children and our dog.

You can tell he's a techie because the house came outfitted with voice-activated multi-colored living room lights, uber-digital thermostat, video doorbell, and an ultra-widescreen computer monitor in the main bedroom.  Our only negative was an almost non-functional toilet handle that needs repair--an easy fix.  Overall, we loved the stay and would highly recommend it to friends.",

The home is very clean and allows easy access to a spacious deck granting great views of the Potomac River. The front yard is nice and spacious with plenty of room for outdoor activities. There are 2 kitchens with lots of space to cook for large gatherings, 2 living rooms equipped with TVs and couches to seat a lot of people, a movie room with great automatic seats to relax in, and a game room with a pool table and foosball table for some fun. There was certainly plenty of space for our group of 16. All of the bedrooms were nicely furnished with king and queen beds. Also, the service for the house was phenomenal. We had one of our family members lose an earring during our stay. We reached out to the management and they had the cleaning crew do a full search for us. Overall, our stay was excellent - 5 out of 5 Stars!",

The home is very clean and allows easy access to a spacious deck granting great views of the Potomac River. The front yard is nice and spacious with plenty of room for outdoor activities. There are 2 kitchens with lots of space to cook for large gatherings, 2 living rooms equipped with TVs and couches to seat a lot of people, a movie room with great automatic seats to relax in, and a game room with a pool table and foosball table for some fun. There was certainly plenty of space for our group of 16. All of the bedrooms were nicely furnished with king and queen beds. Also, the service for the house was phenomenal. We had one of our family members lose an earring during our stay. We reached out to the management and they had the cleaning crew do a full search for us. Overall, our stay was excellent - 5 out of 5 Stars!",

The apartment is decorated with Ikea type furniture but was reasonably comfortable.  Kitchen and bathroom are excellent.  Stocked with very basic amenities but all we needed for a two night stay.  Second night got a little stuffy--as noted in description there are no controls for HVAC in the unit and it felt like the AC might have been turned off or raised to a higher temperature.  Since we were leaving in the morning it was not an issue but this type of \"English basement\" unit could really use it's own split system AC in the summer.  Also, footstep noises from upstairs could be a bit loud at times, but it was quiet at night.  AU Park is a nice area close to American University and many attractions.  It would be a bit cramped for more than two, but in all this is a great hotel alternative for short term stays",

There is a private entrance (separate from main living area) with a customized pin to enter. \n\n\nBathroom:\n\nFull sized bathroom with a stand up shower sink and toilet with a heated floor. This space includes complimentary travel sized shampoo and conditioners, hand soap, bath towels, hand towels, and wash cloths.\n\nSleeping Area:\n\nThe bedroom has a full sized mattress on a platform style bed frame. A fan is located above the bed as well as a lamp on the night stand. \n\nKitchenette:\n\nThis area includes all basic cooking accessories with the exception of a full stove and/or oven. Cooking pans, utensils, and a hot plate are available to cook small meals. Also included: microwave, mini fridge, single cup coffee maker with k-cups, dishes, bowls, mugs, cups, cutting board. A small eating table with two chairs are located off to the side of the countertop.\n\nLiving Room Area:\n\nA couch and coffee table with a 65” smart TV mounted to the wall is located in the rear of the suite.

Please read below  \n\nThe heat/AC compressor is located right outside of the unit and has a humming sound from the fan, and is a bit loud when the compressor kicks on and off.\n\nI have two cats in the living space above the guest suite. They have never entered into the suite, however, they do run back and forth sometimes which can be heard through the floor. (Please let me know if it is ever bothersome). Guests with extreme cat allergies may have a reaction from the shared air circulation. \n\nThis is a townhome with residents on both side so normal noises may also occur such as dogs barking/people talking outside.\n\n\nSmall quiet animals are welcome for an extra $60 cleaning fee per week. A $150 security deposit is also required when booking to cover any potential damages for things like scratching, chewing, and urine. There is a fenced in backyard for dogs but please clean up after your pet before leaving. Please inform me prior to booking so that I may request funds.\n\n\nOn premise parking is available for one vehicle. On street parking is also available and is first come-first serve which is available across the street from the townhouse.\n\nPlease keep guest count to what was requested when booking.\n\nSmoking is allowed outside only. Smoking indoors will incur a $150 cleaning fee.\n\nThe entire suite is thoroughly cleaned and sanitized according to Airbnb’s 5 step enhanced cleaning protocols and CDC recommendations for neutralizing covid. Hand sanitizer and disinfectant will be available as soon as you enter to re-clean anything for your piece of mind.",

I have worked hard building a financial planning firm from scratch the last 20 years and really love helping people. In my down time, I enjoy DC sightseeing, meeting new people and taking advantage of the nearby hiking and camping. I hope you enjoy visiting our town.",

    "summary": "Enjoy a very clean and comfortable stay with easy access to a beautiful park and walking trails in a serene neighborhood. CENTRALLY located with easy access to all major highways. Located only 10 min away from DC Monuments and 5 min to a ROBUST downtown Arlington NIGHTLIFE with a huge selection of bars and restaurants. Shower water pressure is AMAZING! You’ll LOVE my place because of the location, neighborhood, outdoors space, and HOMEY feel.\n\n *NOT for parties or heavy drinking and loud music.",
    "space": "Metro Stations, restaurants, grocery stores, convenience stores, gas stations, and shopping centers with major chains are all within a mile or less! My place is clean and tidy with GREAT shower water pressure.\n\nThere is FREE parking on the street directly in front of the home.\n\nEASY access to DC sights and Reagan National Airport.\n\nThis is my secondary residence and it is, of course, decorated with personal items, memorabilia and family photos. Most people enjoy this COMFY and HOMEY environment. You will get the feeling of staying in a warm, friendly,  and WELCOMING DC local destination.\n\nOther 3BR/8 person residences in the area, this close to DC, typically run $350-$500 a night. My place is an incredible value!\n\n(A couple of places may \"look\" like they charge less however, I do not charge a cleaning fee.)\n\n *NOT for parties or heavy drinking and loud music. There are outdoor security cameras and if at any point there are more people on the property than registered (max 8) your group will be forced to leave  immediately with no refund. This is AirBnB as well as Arlington County policy.\n\n*NOTE: It DOES NOT matter if you say only 8 are sleeping here. There CANNOT be more than 8 on the property at any time.",
    "access": "You will have access to all of the bedrooms, the living room, kitchen, sunporch and outside patio. Front door has an electronic lock and each bedroom has its own key.\n\nIf you are a group of six, then each bedroom will hold two. If a group of eight, a queen sized air mattress is available to be set up in the living room or wherever you prefer.\n\nThere is one bathroom that will be solely used by your group.\n\nWasher and dryer is not available.\n\nAccess to my personal, separate basement apartment/storage area is not available. (Not used for AirBnB guests or any other type of guest.)",
    "notes": "I want guests to feel extremely comfortable during their stay, which includes cleanliness. Upon each guests departure, all bedding is washed and dried at the highest temperature. The room is vacuumed and dusted. Bathroom, toilet and shower are scrubbed. Common areas are cleaned, vacuumed and dusted.\n\nI also have spread Diatomaceous Earth under all of the furniture. This is a naturally occurring substance that keeps insects away. It is 100% natural and food grade. I went this route instead of spraying chemicals in the home every month. You may see this fine white powder if you look under furniture. It is not dirt, or mold, or anything of that nature. It is purposely applied.\n\nAlso, it is GREAT for killing bed bugs and roaches immediately, before they can multiply, should any guest ever accidently bring them into the home.\n\nIf you are in any way concerned about this substance, please read the Wikipedia entry on the subject. It is used in all grain storage in America (so it is in our food) and approved by the FDA.",
    "neighborhood": "The house is located across the street from Bon Air Memorial Rose Garden Park. This expansive 24-acre park includes a basketball court, child's playground, 4-mile Run bike/running trail, tennis courts, volleyball courts, baseball diamond, scenic creek, picnic areas with charcoal grills and a large open field.\n\nNorth Arlington is already one of the lowest crime and safest areas of the country. My home is located on a dead end street so even lower traffic and more safety. Feel safe going for a walk in the neighborhood, a run on the bike path or a picnic in the park.\n\nIf it's winter and there is snow, we have some great hills to sled!",
    "transit": "There is free parking on the street in front of my home. However, I will need to provide you with a pass. (Please return it upon your departure.) Up to 3 passes are available. If you have more than 3 vehicles, there is unrestricted parking available very close by (within 100 yards.)\n\nConvenient access to MetroBus and MetroRail. It is an easy $1.75 bus ride to Ballston Metro, one mile away. Buses run every 12 minutes during the week from 6am to 8pm. Every 30 minutes before and after that and on weekends. Any #1 bus (1A, 1B, 1E, 1Z) will get you to Ballston Metro. Any #1 bus (1A, 1B, 1E, 1Z) will return you from Ballston Metro. If needed, I can provide you a link to the schedule.\n\nIf you will be touring the city using the MetroRail, it is best to purchase a SmartTrip card. Transfers from MetroRail to MetroBus using SmartTrip cards are free. Bus usage without transfer but with SmartTrip card are discounted. I can provide you with more information about getting around DC using public transit. It is a very efficient and enjoyable system to use.\n\nIf you wish to drive from the house and park at the Metro, the best station is East Falls Church. There is a large parking lot and it is only two miles away.",
    "interaction": "You will not have access to the seperate basement apartment. That is for storage, tools, and repair facilities. It is seperated with it's own entrance. I do not spend any time in the main part of the house so guests can expect full privacy.\n\nI am sometimes in my apartment and available for questions and help. You will not have to worry about your group being quiet. You will not have to worry about noise or disturbance from me.\n\nThere is NO shared ventilation from heat or A/C so no risk of airborne spread of viruses.\n\n*NOT used for any AirBnB guest or any other type of guest.",
    "house_rules": "A government issued I.D. that matches the name and profile photo of the guest booking is required to be presented upon check-in. This is to protect you from someone hacking your account and fraudulently booking in your name. Unfortunately, this has become a common scam in the AirBnB community. Thank you for your cooperation.\n\n*IMPORTANT* According to AirBnB policy, the number of guests and children MUST be accurate. If you arrive with more guests or an inaccurate count of adults vs children,  your reservation will be immediately cancelled upon arrival. (\"Children\" is anyone 12 years old and younger.) If you make a reservation, and the number of guests or children changes, it is easy to \"modify\" your booking before arrival.\n\nIf a party is thrown that includes people who are not registered as guests, heavy drinking, illegal drug-use or extremely loud music then you will be forced to leave without a refund.",

She went above and beyond accommodating us, by updating the fridge and purchasing an outdoor bbq for us during our stay.\n\nThe house is spotless with awesome amenities including special make-up removing wash cloths! Amy makes guests feel welcome with these small and thoughtful details she sets the house up with.\n\nYou will have everything you need and more to make this your home away from home.\n\nHighly recommend!",

It’s also a five minute walk from the bus that can take you to the Ballston  metro to get into DC. I had three little boys with me and they love the house too. There’s a backyard as well. Everything was so clean and so comfortable. Amy also saved the day for us! We had another airbnb scheduled ahead of hers and it flopped on us. I contacted Amy and we were able to check in right away. It was late and my boys were exhausted from\nMoving from Ohio and she totally made everything better. \nYou will not regret staying here, I promise! \nHer home has everything you could possibly think you need kitchen wise. I can’t believe how stocked everything was. I will be recommending Amy’s place to anyone who comes in to the area for a long-term or short-term stay. Beautiful home and adorable neighborhood! The beds are INCREDIBLE!",

Julia’s place is just as described and check-in was seamless & there is free parking available and street parking too. The area is quiet and a few miles away from downtown Georgetown but there are bikes, mass transit and plenty of Ubers to get you going to your destination. Highly recommend!",

It is very clean, modern and has all the amenities. My visit was marred by the fact that for two of the four nights, what I assume were Julia's teenage children were up late (well past midnight) talking, laughing and walking around on the floor right above the apartment. I suggest confirming with Julia that won't be a problem before booking.   Other than that, I recommend staying here.",

    "summary": "Brand new fully refurbished English Basement Studio Apartment in the Georgetown/Palisades neighborhood of Washington, DC. Perfect for a single visitor or couple here for pleasure, business, or a Georgetown University course.",
    "space": "Private basement studio apartment with outside entrance. Our home is very comfortable and located in a very quiet part of town, especially considering our proximity to the heart of Georgetown! It's the perfect mix of city and privacy. In 2014 we totally renovated the back patio so it is a great place to relax and grill out and watch for the occasional deer to pass by.",
    "access": "Patio space and outdoor grill are shared with upstairs owners and guests.",
    "notes": "This is a basement apartment and therefore subject to noise from upstairs. If you are highly sensitive to noise, I suggest you book another place or a hotel.  There is no washer or dryer in your space, but use of the upstairs washer and dryer MAY be available upon request.\n\nAlthough our street is a cul-de-sac and is usually quiet we do get airplane noise from flights coming into Reagan National Airport. The planes fly over the Potomac River and we are close to the Potomac River. It is not all the air traffic, they (Reagan National Flight controllers) mix it up and adjust to weather patterns and it quiets down in the evening.",
    "neighborhood": "Our neighborhood is a gem for anyone who enjoys a touch of nature in the city. We are close to Georgetown University, the C&O canal tow path and Capital Crescent Bike trail, Georgetown and Palisades neighborhoods. There is no Metro in Georgetown but we are a quick walk to a Metro bus stop. There are also e-bikes, and other rentable transportation at the Hardy Recreation bus stop. There are also DC circulator buses in Georgetown taking you all over the city for one low daily price. Finally if you don't mind a walk, the Rosslyn metro station is 1.1 miles away across the Key Bridge about a 25 -30 minute walk.",
    "transit": "You may use public transportation by bus or walk to the metro, there are Capital Bikes to share and you will be close to hop onto bike trails. Uber and Lyft are very reasonable and quick. There is also a private bus company called the DC Circulator which is very reasonable and has routes all over the city and into Arlington, VA.",
    "interaction": "I have a detailed guest book with restaurant and activity suggestions for your convenience. I am also happy to help guests get acquainted with the area when I am home and I am ALWAYS available by phone or text once booked.",
    "house_rules": "- Keep music and TV to low levels after 10PM.\n- Use of the fireplace is a privilege, any manipulation of fireplace logs or gas settings will result in forfeit of security deposit. Fireplace is not an ashtray and will result in forfeit of security deposit. You agree to notify host immediately if you have any questions about how to use fireplace.",

You can walk right in the stables and pet the horse's noses.  There are also some friendly pigs outside that like to be pet.   The owners brought out some of the horses to put them in one of the fenced in areas so we could watch them play, graze, and pet them over the fence.  The property is huge with some interesting horse trails you can walk. We had beautiful sunsets then used the fire pit that had a huge wood pile beside it. It was a great place to stay! Highly recommended.",

I have zero connections to the owners, and everything said previously (all the good) is true. This place is magical and Rita and her family have gone out of their way to ensure that the loft is absolutely pristine and ready for guests. Rita is a pleasure to communicate with and ensured that we had all of the information that we asked about prior to our arrival. The rooms were lovely and had just every amenity that you could want for. \n\nThe barn and surrounding area was bucolic. The animals (donkeys and horses) a joy to interact with. The barn is impressively clean and the animals are all obviously loved and well cared for. \n\nI would gladly return and will actively seek opportunities to do so in the near future.",

In fact, the apartment itself was even larger than it seems in photos. There were so many thoughtful touches inside, like snacks, toiletries (even mouthwash!), and farm fresh eggs that we requested beforehand. The guidebook inside was also super helpful! \n\nYou can tell that no expense was spared in this rental. I usually don’t expect much from air b&b kitchens, but this one was fully equipped and well stock with high quality items. The cute dishware and marble countertops felt luxurious! \n\nRita was also kind enough to allow us to use the pool (also beautiful!) and bonfire. We asked a lot of questions throughout our stay, and Rita was always helpful, responsive, and friendly.\n\nOne of the best Airbnb’s I’ve been to—highly recommend this relaxing and unique space!",

They were helpful, super responsive and provided excellent personal recommendations for restaurants and things to-do in the area. My kids were super excited about their stay at the sneaky fox farm and Rita and Dave went out of their way to make their stay even better, spending so much time with them with the animals (who were super nice too  by the way).

    "summary": "We are close to Morven Park, Rose Hill Manor, Downtown Leesburg, White's Ferry Manor\n\nPool is open May-Sept\n\nRetreat away to scenic Sneaky Fox Farm, a newly-constructed barn apartment which sits above our working horse farm. We are conveniently located less than 5 minutes from Historic Downtown Leesburg and within minutes to Loudoun’s best wineries and breweries. Our property offers the feeling of abundant open-space all the while being a stone’s throw away from all that Loudoun has to offer.",
    "space": "Sip your morning coffee on the side porch while looking out onto our tranquil pastures. \n\nWe constructed this space from a hay loft to a beautiful barn apartment in 2020. There is a queen size bed in the bedroom and the couch pulls out to a second queen sized bed. This loft is set up for guests to stay and revel in the beautiful natural world of Loudoun County, including a fire pit, quaint side porch, grill, and nearby Balls Buff Battlefield for hiking. Nature and animals are quite literally at your front steps.\n\nThe loft sits directly above our barn so you may hear noises such as snorts, brays, and neighs. Our mini pigs and donkeys are noisy mostly at feeding time. \n\nIf animal noises, smells, and the occasional insect are not your thing, this space may not be the right place for you. We invite our guests to experience the activities of our working horse farm, including joining us to experience feeding the horses which occurs every morning and evening.  Farm fresh eggs are available on request as long as the girls are laying! \n\nDuring the summer months, arrangements can be made separately to use our in ground swimming pool.",
    "access": "The loft is located above the barn and is it’s own dedicated space",
    "notes": "During certain months of the year we attend horse events and can be in barn in the early morning (sometimes before sun up). While we do our best to not disturb anyone, those who are very light sleepers should be aware.",
    "neighborhood": "The property is at the back of a quiet residential neighborhood",
    "transit": "There is a large gravel parking lot to the left of the barn for our guests. Please do not be alarmed if another car or trailer is parked in that space. We will to our best to keep it completely clear while guests are on our property!",

Jenny and Stephen are wonderful hosts and wonderful people. The place looks exactly as described, it is a very peaceful area but yet lots of restaurants around and close to everything. This place is good for both, families or just couples, everything is new and extremely clean. Jenny and Stephen are very responsive and very proactive to make sure your stay is the best possible experience. I highly recommend this place, this family, this area, just all of it. This place became my home away from home -and will be my choice every time I’m back in DC. Thank you so much again for everything!",

Bike rentals close by. Beautiful walking/biking trails. The house is a good size for 2 adults and 1 kid. The common area is a bit small but if you’re like us, you’ll be out most of the day so it’s not too big of a deal. The hosts were super responsive and there’s even a desk with Ethernet hookup if you have to do some work like I did. Super pet friendly area too!",

    "summary": "Enjoy this newly built D.C. carriage house, its close to everything and in one of D.C.'s nicest neighborhoods, making your visit seamless & fun. We have free and abundant street parking (no hourly limit), a Starbucks, playground, a park and several other restaurants within a short walking distance. \n\nThe Palisades is a quiet, peaceful neighborhood close to downtown D.C. We are located 3 miles from Georgetown, 1.5 miles from American University, and 5 miles from the National Mall/White House.",
    "space": "The carriage house is located in the backyard of a separate primary residence. Guests do not need to enter the backyard to enter the property. The carriage house can be accessed via a private entrance from the green alley next to the property. The bedroom (king bed and folding twin-size cot), full bath, and washer/dryer are located on the second floor. A pull-out couch, pack and play, kitchen and a powder room are located on the first floor.",
    "neighborhood": "According to the Washington Post, the Palisades is \"quiet, verdant and close to downtown. Of the many friendly faces you’ll see while strolling around the Palisades neighborhood in Northwest Washington — dog walkers, mail carriers and cyclists — the most charming of them all will be the neighborhood itself. Its woods, paths along the Potomac and houses neatly tucked into nature are pleasantly quiet and a delight to explore. It’s a great place to raise a family.\"\n\nThe private entrance for this house is accessible from the alley closest to the intersection of Dorsett Pl and Galena Pl NW.",
    "transit": "The carriage house is located on an alley that is adjacent to free street parking. Driving to the Palisades from Virginia and Maryland is easy, as it is located near major thoroughfares of Canal Rd and Chain Bridge Rd.\n\nBiking is easy with Capital Crescent trail located .5 miles away, the paved trail runs south to Georgetown, north to Bethesda, and connects to the rest of D.C. via bike.",
    "interaction": "Owners of the house live in the primary residence (the bigger house) on the property and are available to help with any issues during your stay.\n\nWe have a backyard that connects the main house to the carriage house but our two dogs use it frequently so please let us know before using it so we can make sure our dogs are inside (they are old and grumpy).",
    "house_rules": "Per DC Code Section 9901.12, \"Occupancy in a short-term rental shall be limited to a maximum of eight (8) transient guests, or two (2) guests per bedroom, whichever is greater.\"\n\nOur carriage house comfortably sleeps 4. For sleeping, there is a king bed, a pull-out couch, a folding cot, and a pack and play crib (by request).",

A violation of the House Rules will result in eviction without a refund.\n\nUnauthorized guests, visitors, or pets are not permitted. Our home is in an extremely quiet and sensitive neighborhood. Any excessive noise or traffic will cause the neighbors to report to the police. The unauthorized visitor/guest fee is $100/person and the pet fee is $250/pet. We observe strict quiet hours from 10:00 pm-8:00 am. Amplified music is not permitted at any time.\n\nGuests that are under 25 years old OR residents of D.C., Maryland, or Virginia need to contact the Host before Instant Booking. \n\nSome property insurance providers require the Host to collect the name and picture of a government-issued photo ID for each guest. If requested, the Guest agrees to provide this information within three (3) hours of booking confirmation or the reservation will be canceled.\n\nFor the comfort of our guests, neighbors, and team members, smoking of any kind (marijuana, cigarettes, or vaping) is not permitted within thirty (30) feet of the property, including outdoor spaces. Should our team or neighbors report the odor of smoke, a $250 fee will be applied.\n\nOur property is booked back-to-back and our cleaning system is a carefully orchestrated process. At select properties, with a day's notice, we can accommodate an early check-in or late checkout of up to three (3) hours for a flat fee paid in advance. Should our home become ready earlier than 4:00 pm, we'll invite you to check in at no extra charge. Standard checkout is 10:00 am and the overstay fee is $100.\n\nUnfortunately, we are not able to offer cancellations, refunds, or rescheduling due to weather or inability to access the property. We are not able to guarantee the possibility of public roads. We do our best to keep driveways and walkways passable, but the guest may be required to shovel the driveway and/or walkways.\n\nThe moderate cleaning fee is to sanitize our home. Guests are required to wash/dry/return dishes, collect excess trash, hang wet towels, and return furniture to its original location. Our lovely cleaning staff will do the laundry, wipe down surfaces, vacuum, and make the beds. If our home requires additional cleaning, a supplementary cleaning fee will be collected.",

The space was perfect for what we wanted: a comfortable home, plenty of bedrooms, a big yard for the dog to run around in, and an excellent location in walking distance to Connecticut Ave and its retail establishments near Chevy Chase Circle. The neighborhood was very peaceful and beautiful. There was plenty of space for street parking, a rarity in DC. The beds were all very comfortable. The only drawback was that the home is a duplex, with a unit above ours (as opposed to side-by-side). Over our month visit, there were different guests above us (often with children), which resulted in the fact that we could hear people occasionally stomping or running which was distracting. We were not aware of this setup when we booked. \n\nJack was absolutely wonderful to communicate with. He was not only very responsive, but also very friendly. We couldn't have asked for a better host.",

The neighborhood was perfect and we always had a place to park 2 cars.\nHis rental is spotless.  The kitchen was fully equipped with everything we needed to cook meals. The beds were comfortable, towels were clean and fresh.  His home was tastefully decorated.\nWe cooked our meals and ate in the dining room.\n\nMy daughter loved the bathroom!!\n\nWould definitely stay here again.",

When something minor went wrong, she was very quick to get it fixed. Great place for families, especially since it’s on a quiet street and near a playground, but if you have babies, just be aware there’s stairs up to the second floor and down to the living room.",

It’s very accessible to Arlington and D.C. \n\nI would highly recommend this location to anyone else. The house was also stacked with several extra toiletries such as toothpaste, toothbrush, shampoo, conditioner, and a bunch of towels. \n\nWe consistently felt right at home here!",

We had little kids and there were all sorts of parks east on the trail. Somehow feels private when still close proximity to so much in Arlington. Great backyard for our dog. Perfect location to travel east into DC easily or go west to hit wineries/hiking/air and space museum. Probably my favorite air bnb I’ve ever stayed at.

The house was beautiful, clean and the location was very peaceful (surrounded by trees and beautiful flowers). Each room had it’s own feel but one thing each room had in common was beautiful fluffy queen size beds. Parking was a little different just because the driveway was so steep. But we just parked right in front of the house which was actually better to us. We will definitely stay again when we revisit D.C. The location was perfect not being far from downtown and other areas but also away from all of the busyness and traffic that D.C can bring. Silvia also worked with us concerning our check-out time. Which was very kind seeing that she didn’t have to. Her home is definitely a hidden gem for booking an Airbnb and I strongly recommend if you have a traveling group this house would be a must book. Thanks again Silvia you made this trip one to remember.",

The neighborhood felt safe and was easily accessible by Metra (also felt safe here!) and to local restaurants / groceries. Bed was THE most comfortable we’ve ever had (7 yrs of Airbnb travel here) and several extras to boot! Only reason for 4 out of 5 (and would have made it 4.5 if possible) - bathroom could use a little TLC. Maybe add another shelf and reset towel rack for more “space” to set items. Would stay here again!",

The bed was a little firmer than we like, but the fold-out couch was surprisingly comfortable. The dishwasher was a nice bonus, and if you're traveling with youngsters they have kids' books, games, and a toddler toilet seat. It's a very short walk to East Falls Church Metro (10 minutes is generous, it's more like 5), which would've been really helpful if the Metro weren't down for maintenance on our visit! Benjamin Banneker Park is also right next door, and its playground is really really nice for cooped-up kids. All in all, I think it's a really good deal for the area. Be forewarned that there's a short flight of stairs to get into the basement, so the place isn't wheelchair-accessible and might be difficult to navigate with lots of luggage.",

Roger left us some treats which were appreciated after a long travel day.  Really enjoyed our stay and highly recommend for anyone visiting the DC, Arlington, Falls Church area.\n\nP.S.  The above floors were occupied, but the residents were obviously very conscious of downstairs guests.  We hardly knew they were there.",

    "access": "Guests will have access to the entire basement/ground level private apartment of this home.",
    "neighborhood": "We love our location! Nestled in a quiet neighborhood, yet only a block from a Metro station with DC at your fingertips. Our street doubles as part of the regional bike/running trail network – known as the Washington & Old Dominion trail. We are steps from the newest playground in Arlington. There are local restaurants just down the street that we like to get takeout from (or sit down at, pre-covid): Yayla Bistro (Turkish), and Cote d’Or (French) for special occasions. You can also walk to South Block, a coffee/smoothie shop that is a local DC chain.\n\nIn a short 5-minute drive (or 20 minute walk on a nice day), you find yourself in Westover, a beautiful local shopping area in Arlington. Recommend Lost Dog Café or The Italian Store, as well as the Westover Market for necessities and an extensive beer selection. If you find yourself in need of just about anything you can probably find it at Ayer’s Hardware.\n\nIn the opposite direction, you are a similar 5-minute drive or 20 minute walk to Falls Church, known as “The Little City” and it has a great community feel. On your way there (walking), stop by Café Kindred for a coffee or brunch. There is a Saturday morning farmer’s market at the town community center. Dine with the locals at Dogwood Tavern or Claire and Don’s Beach Shack, and catch live music at the State Theater next door. Maneki Neko is a great spot for sushi, right on the main street (Broad St/Rt 7), and Northside Social is another option for a caffeinated drink and brunch.\n\nOf course, all of these attractions are a short walk or drive from the apartment. A short drive or metro ride puts you right in the center of all the DC area has to offer.",
    "transit": "East Falls Church Metro subway station is only a block away – from there it is a 24-minute ride (no transfers!) to the Smithsonian stop (National Mall, museums). \n\nBike share is available at the Metro station. \n\nUber and Lyft are always readily available. We are one block from the entrance to I-66, a short 10-minute drive to the DC line.",

No feminine products, baby wipes, contraceptives, nor paper towels should be flushed at anytime. If it is found that any of these items have been flushed and clog the septic system you could be held responsible for the cost of repair.\nABSOLUTELY NO Smoking or Vaping of any kind inside the apartment; young children live upstairs.\nABSOLUTELY NO Parties or Events.",

Driveway is over a narrow bridge and then very steep- in the event of snow or ice I imagine it would be difficult to traverse. If traveling with kids, bring games, books, activities as there is nothing besides the TV to keep them entertained in your downtime. Overall, good spot to stay and could be great with some TLC and attention to detail.",

He left us well stocked with wood pellets and firewood, and called on the first day to make sure we knew how to run the pellet stove (pro tip: don't leave the lid open longer than 60 seconds). His home is really well situated. It's minutes from the GW Parkway, I-495, and Mclean proper, making it convenient to get places. Even with that, it's very quiet/private: your only visitors will be foxes and roving mobs of deer who are wholly unafraid of you. There are some beautiful views from the giant windows all over the house. \n\nThe flip side to those giant windows is that it can get a little nippy when it's cold but that's where the fireplace and stove come in. All in all, this is a wonderful home for a family or private getaway. Five stars.",

Everything was top-notch, and the host thought of so many details to make the house comfortable.\n\nThe kitchen is stocked with everything you need to cook a variety of meals, including an air fryer and outdoor grill. \n\nPlenty of space for a family to spread out but still have dinner and play games together.\n\nVery nice neighbors in a very quiet, walkable neighborhood.\n\nHighly recommend for short or long stays where you want to feel \"at home.\"\n\nThis home may be new to Air B&B, but the host seems to have thought of everything!",

The neighborhood consisted of single family residences and was quiet for the area. \nTiny ants can be a problem in the kitchen so don't leave any food out if you visit during warmer months and the air filter needs to be changed.\nIf you're seeking a hotel alternative for an extended stay, I highly recommend this rental.",

We were in town visiting family nearby and needed a place to stay for 2 weeks, so we appreciated having a fully functional kitchen to make meals and a private space. Check-in and check-out was very easy and Damien was quite responsive to any questions we had by message. We met on one occasion and he was also very friendly. As other reviews mentioned, the house was a bit dusty and we felt the need to clean a bit before using things in the kitchen, but it wasn't as bad as some other reviews seemed to suggest. Nothing shocking. Comfortable bed, nice shower. Overall, I would recommend Damien's place if you're looking for something in this area.",

Since, I have traveled to places where I have been hosted by locals and that made it personal and authentic.That kind of travel introduced me to places and sites tourist do not get to see and this deepened my understanding of every culture I have been introduced to. And so I felt it is time to return some of that favor by sharing my space with those who are exploring the area where I live and offer them a home away from home and be hospitable and available to make the experience authentic and memorable. \r\nI love to travel, read and engage in meaningful and purposeful relational work that might impact our world for the better. I love my morning coffee, my walks in the park, and for sure my ethnic Lebanese food. My home is my sanctuary  of rest and rejuvenation and my garden is where I get the closest to meditation and reflection. And most of all, I love to spend time with my granddaughter.\r\nWelcome ! I am happy to share.\r\n",

Finally, the host lives on the same property in a separate house behind the house that we stayed in, which may be a consideration if you are looking for absolute privacy.  All in all, it was a great find.",

    "summary": "Century-old country house in Maryland near the DC metro area.  Come relax or enjoy local adventures!  Easy access to great cycling, boating, hiking, wineries, and nature.  The house is furnished with interesting decor from 30 years spent overseas.  3 rooms available, with a total of 4 beds, and two bathrooms.  Nearby train line, visitors should expect to hear passing trains.  Manager lives on-property in a separate building.  Must be feline friendly, cat in residence!",
    "space": "This is an old house, built at the beginning of the 20th century.  Expect an antique and rustic feel.  The owner of the house spent her career overseas, and lots of the stuff in the house is from all over the world.  We are about 100 yards from the historic Barnesville train station, with MARC train service to D.C., so please expect to hear the rumble of trains from time to time (we don't even hear it, but newcomers say it's loud!).",
    "access": "You are welcome to go anywhere in the house, except for one storage room.  The property is on 3 acres, with one other building where the bnb manager lives.  Feel free to wander around and enjoy the yard and porch and deck.",
    "notes": "You must be cat friendly!  A cat named Rory is in residence, she will be polite to you and probably ask you to let her in or out, depending on her mood.  I usually come into the house early in the mornings to feed her, so please don't let that surprise you.  Also of note, our house is walking distance from the MARC train, so commuters from DC could come without a car.  The nearby train line does have traffic during the day and night, so don't be surprised when you hear it!",
    "neighborhood": "Quiet Barnesville, Maryland is a small town in what is left of Montgomery County's rural countryside, near Sugarloaf Mountain.  Our house is on the outskirts of the town, right next to the rural train station, with weekday train access to Washington, D.C.",
    "transit": "There is one carport and ample parking for 2 or  more vehicles along the driveway.   The house is on MD route 109, a rural road.",
    "interaction": "I live in a small house up the hill, and will be around for most of your stay.  I'll hope to meet you and make your acquaintance at some point!  And please be amenable to the house's true owner, Rory the Cat, who tends to wander at will.",
    "house_rules": "Enjoy the house and garden, but make sure to leave things as you found them!  This includes use of the kitchen and other amenities.  A cat named Rory lives in the house and will probably ask you to let her in or out, feel free to comply with her wishes!",

Because the house is pet friendly we found dog hair on the clothes after the first night's sleep and the host changed the blanket.

The location was perfect for us.  There are 2 grocery stores and lots of restaurants a few minutes away. The access to downtown was great. We drove to and parked at the West Falls Church metro parking lot and took the subway right to the L'Enfant Plaza stop for the Smithsonian Air & Space museum. Lastly,Julia is a great communicator.  Every time I made a request, she replied very quickly to resolve.  One item to note that the thermostat is upstairs. There is a radiator and Julia's was open to temperature requests.  The price is reasonable for the area.  We had a great weekend.",

We didn’t spend too much actually in the home as we were out in the city for most of the day, but it served us well while we were there. Everything was simple and the location was great, perfect and easy access to the metro which we used every day, didn’t even have to drive anywhere :) I didn’t need to communicate with Judith much but she was very helpful and sweet the few messages we did exchange. Everything was smooth and easy, would definitely recommend!!",

We didn’t spend too much actually in the home as we were out in the city for most of the day, but it served us well while we were there. Everything was simple and the location was great, perfect and easy access to the metro which we used every day, didn’t even have to drive anywhere :) I didn’t need to communicate with Judith much but she was very helpful and sweet the few messages we did exchange. Everything was smooth and easy, would definitely recommend!!",

The Cottage itself is very cute and well appointed.  During our stay, the person renting the main home on the property was very friendly and helpful with all sorts of suggestions on what we could do.  If only we had more time there to take advantage of all the wonderful suggestions!  And, this may seem like a silly thing to some, but as someone with allergies to various things, I really appreciate that highly fragranced products were not used on the bed linens or in the bathroom products.  Thank you ever so much, Judith, and I hope we can someday return to your lovely cottage!",

The place was very clean, unique, had everything we needed to feel at home, and was an easy walk to all the sites we wanted to see. \nAlso close to a big supermarket which was handy, and few steps to dozens of restaurants and cafes. Communication was great too. The host ( Jay ) was very nice, easy to talk to and very friendly when he welcomed us. I would definitely come again! \nWe would highly recommend this wonderful apartment and great hosts.",

Although it is described inside the listing, the main heading is little deceiving (4 BR/2 Office). But when I contacted Jack about this at 12 in the night he was so helpful by accommodating with bathroom in his unit. He is very friendly and attentive to feedback. As we are a group of 3 different families with kids included, it became an inconvenience. Partly our mistake to miss the detail tucked inside the listing.\nWill definitely stay if traveling as single family group.\n\nAll the guests in our group liked rest of this place..Good parking space in front..",

Its a very big house and my family of 7 fit in with ease. The house is stuffed with supplies, we had to worry about nothing. It was my best airbnb experience.

Easy to get around, especially since we lived in DC for 10 years - 20 minute nice walk to nearest Metro (Friendship Heights). Quite close to shopping areas in both Friendship Heights and Bethesda. Nice little patio for sitting outside in good weather. This is an upscale neighborhood and quite pretty.",

There was a small issue with the HVAC but she had it sorted out immediately. People should note that the beds, particularly the master, are very firm. Didn’t bother me, but I can see how plush lovers not care for them. And while we didn’t use it, it was a nice surprise to see that they had an extra double bed for us to use.\nGorgeous, walkable neighborhood. I brought a classic car that I wanted off street, so the driveway access was handy. The metro is a 15-20 minute walk, but you always feel safe, and there are some pretty sights on the way.\n\nOverall it was very clean and accommodating. Would definitely stay here again.",

We were looking for a temporary place to stay nearby while power lines were being repaired and tree debris/damage were being cleaned from our house.  When we saw Mike's place as available, we immediately reached out and Mike was responsive  reassuring, and supportive amid a very stressful time for our family. The house is amazing - lots of space, well decorated, clean, great location - our three year old loved the \"new house\". Extra bonus for it being next door to Heidelberg pasty shoppe and closely located to other neighborhood favorites like Modo Mio and Peter Chang's. We felt right at home! We appreciated Mike's communication and support. We will certainly keep his place in mind next time we have family visiting from out of town.",

    "house_rules": "Absolutely! Here's a more friendly version of the rules:\n\n1. Keep it smoke-free: Our home is a smoke-free zone. Please enjoy your smoking breaks outside and dispose of cigarette butts responsibly. We appreciate your cooperation!\n\n2. Respect quiet hours: To ensure everyone's peace and tranquility, kindly keep noise levels down between 9:00 PM and 9:00 AM. Let's create a harmonious environment together!\n\n3. No Parties - Let's keep it low-key: While our home is perfect for relaxation, it's not suitable for parties or large gatherings. There are plenty of places walking distance to have fun. \n\n4. Report any oopsies: Accidents happen! If any damages occur during your stay, please let us know right away so we can address them promptly. We're here to help!\n\n5. Save energy, save the planet: Let's be eco-conscious by turning off lights, electronics, and air conditioning when not in use or when leaving the house. Mother Earth sends her thanks!\n\n6. Be a great neighbor: Show our property and neighbors some love by treating them with respect and kindness. Your thoughtfulness is truly appreciated!\n\n7. We're just a message away: If you have any questions, concerns, or need assistance during your stay, reach out to us through the Airbnb messaging system. We're here to make sure you have a comfortable and enjoyable experience!\n\nPet guidelines: We love furry friends! If you're bringing your pets, please make sure they are well-behaved, supervised, and cleaned up after. To keep things clean and cozy, we kindly request that pets stay off the furniture. And remember, they'll need your company and care at all times. Thank you for being a responsible pet owner!\n\nBy following these friendly guidelines, we can create a warm and welcoming atmosphere for all our guests. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation!",

The first is that parking is, at times, quite challenging. The entire condo complex has very limited visitor parking spaces, and on numerous occasions I would return to find all of them full. With no backup options nearby, my only choice would be to park illegally, then walk around the parking lot every half hour or so until a spot opened up so I wouldn't have to risk being towed.\n\nSecond, the walls are quite thin, so the two very young, very fussy children staying in the next room over were often difficult to tune out. They were mostly quiet at night, but rarely quiet during the day. (I believe they're staying in this room until October.)\n\nOverall, the place suited my needs.",

My folks were with the American Foreign Service, and we lived in Taiwan and the Phillippines (with many trips to Hong Kong).  During that time, my family collected lots of Asian art and antiques which are featured in the flat.\r\n\r\nThe flat really is a fun and comfy place to live!  It’s the best of both city and non-city living:  a bike ride away from DC, but surrounded by woods and a block away from two of the best nature parks in the DC area. International biking teams practice in this part of Arlington, so if you like the outdoors, this is the place for you!  \r\n\r\nI’m a photographer and filmmaker (also a teacher).  I look forward to meeting you and hosting your stay! \r\n",

Yet everything is so close either by walking or driving. I so appreciate that Mary welcomes visitors to her home!",

The pets are a furry, friendly bonus!  Loved it, and look forward to the next visit.",

We loved hosting their friends in the basement for parties, gatherings and sleep overs.  We enjoyed hearing the laughter and cheers through the walls. Since our sons are no longer living here, we have decided to share our basement on Airbnb. We hope that our guests will have as much fun and enjoy the space as much as our children and their friends did. As empty nesters, we have begun to have an appreciation for travel and are excited to share our home with fellow travelers.",

The home has two appearances remodeled in the front (kitchen, living room and master bathroom) every other room is dated with old wood furniture, 1-ply toilet paper, no shower mats. But the biggest issue was old used soap with hair in the shower and black stains on the sheets in master bedroom. The owner admitted his cleaning service hadn’t cleaned the bathroom. The mini tubes of lotion, soap left for use are expired and some half used. The bedrooms did not feel or look refreshed. \nI can not recommend and wish I had selected another home for my stay to bury my mother at Arlington National Cemetery.",

It's situated in a sweet residential neighborhood that's close to amazing and diverse restaurants, local and bigger retail shops, with easy access to major roadways and highways as well as sightseeing in and around the DC area. The home has many options for spending time together, is modernized without losing its original charm, and well-maintained! The host was friendly, responsive, and flexible with our check-in, check-out requests.  Highly recommend this listing!",

These hosts were better than the “5*” hotels that I’ve stayed at in the last. I was skeptical at first because of this. It was my first “foray” into the airbnb world but they were amazing hosts. They even invited me to eat and have dinner, snacks and drinks poolside with their amazing friends and family. They really made me feel at home and I honestly almost cried tears of joy that night. Please stay with them, this is the best experience I could have hoped for!",

It is in a very lovely, very green, very lush part of DC near the Potomac and the National Cathedral.  There is plenty of on-street parking right outside the doorstep.  We had a car to visit Mount Vernon and Great Falls (both about 30 minutes, both very worth the drive), so easy parking was essential.  There is not much in the way or restaurants or grocery stores within walking distance, but a plethora within 10 minutes in the car.  The house itself is very cute, with a wonderful sunroom and backyard.  The house is very well equipped with kitchen utensils and accessories, and the outdoor gas grill even worked...a rarity!  Be aware that the ability to negotiate stairs is a must, as access to the bathrooms requires them.  The hosts were very responsive, and anticipated every concern and addressed it before we even brought it up.  Highly recommended.",

My husband and I are locals—we had to be out of our house for an extended, unplanned home repair and were looking for a quiet place to stay with our dog. What we found was a cozy, warm, adorable, and extremely comfortable home that we really enjoy spending time in! Marissa and Chris have provided so many household items that have made our stay much smoother. The king bed is so comfy, the house is very well appointed, and I’ve lost count of how many cozy blankets there are here. It has been easy to work from home here, as well as to walk our dog (the house is one short block from a “nature trail” along the Potomac). Marissa and Chris are also great—they have been very responsive to messages and are so kind. While we’re looking forward to eventually being able to go back to our own house, we’ll really miss this place!",

It was perfect - short walking distance to everything you need from the grocery store, the red line metro, both NIH and Walter Reed, as well as downtown Bethesda. It’s in a beautiful green neighborhood tucked away so you don’t even notice you’re so close to everything. \n\nThe place had everything I needed for the summer and Karen even had it stocked with everything I forgot or didn’t realize I’d need with her personal touches (like umbrellas and grocery carts). \n\nAlso, Karen was so responsive and kind-hearted. She was proactive and flexible with check-in and check-out, always communicated with me well in advance of needing in the space (which was very rare over the 10 weeks), and included me in the neighborhood activities (4th of July BBQ and many conversations with neighbors). \n\nOverall, Karen is one of the best hosts I have ever had and the place was perfect for me. Definitely would come back!",

The bed is super comfortable.\nThe house is located in a beautiful green and quiet neighborhood, close to the metro, and also near shops and restaurants. There are many great supermarket options like Harris Teeter and Trader Joe's. \nKaren was a perfect host, responding very quickly to questions and needs. She was very flexible and kind. \nLittle details made the most of my stay and like the provision of coffee and tea, and even chocolates!",

The proximity to the Metro Station, stores (Safeway and Target) and local restaurants, coupled with the beautiful home and yard in a quiet neighborhood, made our evenings together just as memorable as our time exploring DC by day.  The house was very clean with a well-stocked kitchen, spacious family areas and bedrooms, plenty of bathrooms and very comfortable beds and and furniture.  Daniel was very attentive to any questions we had, and we would definitely stay in one of his properties again if our travel plans allow.",

The layout is perfect for a group. Mohamed also makes sure you have everything you could need and is very responsive. We felt very lucky to have stayed here and were able to relax completely with the peaceful surroundings of lush green trees. The beds and furniture were all incredibly comfortable and stunning to look at. There are plenty of different seating areas for a group to be able to spend time together and also spread out and get some privacy for themselves. The kitchen is fully stocked, and Mohamed is an incredible host. He greeted us upon arrival and gave us a tour of the home. We even got to try some Egyptian cookies that he set out for us, which were delicious. There are also plenty of restaurants, bakeries, and coffee shops nearby. I would highly recommend staying in this home!",

Photos were accurate which has not been our experience in the past. The house was well stocked with everything you would need and more. Mohamed was meticulous in providing every possible amenity to make you feel like you were in your own home. Lovely area- secluded and quiet and close to many activities. Was one of the nicest properties we have rented. Mohamed was the ultimate host. He met us when we arrived and gave us a tour of the house, was available for questions during our stay and also met with us when we checked out. Would highly recommend this house. We will definitely return!!!",

Would definitely return next time I’m in the area. Very nice accommodation in a luxury high rise apartment, super views, a gym on site and walking distance to Tyson’s Corner Mall. Harris Teeter grocery store just a 10 min walk. Treasa was a friendly and gracious host. Thanks for everything!",

Margie is very kind and offered us some nice tips around the area. Make your reservation and you won't regret it.",

We love antiquing, traveling and spending time with our three children, their significant others and our grandchild. We love hosting guests and friends at the inn and sharing our love for Aldie when they visit. At the Inn, a full breakfast is included in your stay, we use local meats, eggs and serve everything from French toast, to quiche, to Dutch apple baby. The Little River Inn features beautiful rooms decorated with antiques, quilts, hooked and braided rugs, spool beds and 19th-century paintings. The Main House features a sitting room with a fireplace, a patio, porches, two breakfast rooms and a spacious yard our donkeys, Milo and Racer, call home. Located across the driveway from the Main House, the Patent House and Log Cabin are free standing cottages that feature full baths and living rooms and working fireplaces. We serve a full breakfast at 8:30 a.m. every day, prepared from scratch by chef Tucker.\n\nEstablished in 1982.\n\nAfter moving to Aldie, Tucker learned that his great-uncle’s house was for sale, though the buildings were in poor condition, he decided it would be the perfect Bed and Breakfast. Tucker restored the Main house and cabins, while keeping the charm of the historic property, welcoming the first guests in 1982. ",

I also make sure to comply with all local laws regarding renting and I was even involved in the creation of the county ordinance for short term rentals!  That was an interesting process, and it really makes a difference that I live on the premises. \n\nMy philosophy as a host is to provide as much privacy as the guest would like, while also being always available as I live in another section of the house.  \n\nI love being an Airbnb Host as it has been a very happy experience to meet (or text with!) such delightful guests, and it has allowed me to continue living in this wonderful (and unfortunately very expensive) neighborhood.  I have lived in this house for over 25 years, raising two sons, and now it feels very natural to share this great location with travelers from all over the world.  \n\nMy favorite activities are hiking in the surprisingly scenic surroundings of DC or spending time outside gardening.  I do spend a good deal of time on my computer as I’m a website designer with a home-based business.   \n\nI love to travel and I've lived in France and Russia, starting out in both places without speaking the language so I know what it's like not to understand what people are saying.  Eventually I became fluent, and then mostly forgot it all, but the lesson that stayed with me is that people can always find a way to communicate.\n",

Trader Joe's and other shops are literally right around the corner. I had to travel to the DMV for a few weeks and couldn't ask for more perfect place logistically. Not only that, her property is really beautiful and charming. The pictures don't do it justice. The bed is quite comfortable and the shower is absolutely delightful, too. Not to mention, Erika's place is meticulous. You won't find even a crumb on the floor. You also couldn't ask for a better host. Erika is a very welcoming and kind person. If you have any questions, she will respond immediately. She definitely deserves to be called a Superhost. You will love this place. I highly recommend!",

Haven't seen Mary to often, and we couldn't say goodbye because she had to go somewhere, her familymember informed us. But when we saw her, she was warm en lovely. She told us to feel at home and to use surton stuff in the kitchen that we can use, mostly for breakfast. \nThe house felt very american, wich we love because were from europe. Although sometimes it felt as if the house was a little too stuffed. \nWe enjoyed sitting outside but we did need to clean the table a little first. \nWe enjoyed our connection with the other guests as well, we even did a game night! \nOverall we were glad we stayed at Mary's!!!",

He was able to tell us where to find more in the laundry room so it was easily resolved. Also, only one of the TVs was working while we were there. Overall, it was the perfect spot for two couples and had parking for two cars.",

Refrigerator was completely clean and spotless,  the \"coffee bar fixings\" were very appreciated. His housekeeper did a great job of providing a neat and user friendly environment. The appliances were in good working order. We  just had a little moment where we were low on toilet paper our last morning, but a quick email to Neil with his lightening fast response(!) helped us find more in a locked supply area. Parking was no problem and great to always have a spot available in this big city.",

He gives an incentive to rate highly, but even independent of that, I feel he provided a great stay and truly deserves a 5 star rating. Thank you, Anupam!",

The area is pricey so I was a little hesitant when we got the room for an entire weekend for less than the 'deal' the convention offered at the hotel... for a single night! It was even better than the description. The room was bigger than the pictures. Not pictured was the HUGE DVD collection (think movie store!), comfortable glider, and even a Nordic Track! Parking was easy. We were a quick 7 minute drive from the Reston Town Center with every kind of restaurant within a stones throw. When I had an issue locking the front door, he responded instantly. 10/10 recommend",

I also make sure to comply with all local laws regarding renting and I was even involved in the creation of the county ordinance for short term rentals!  That was an interesting process, and it really makes a difference that I live on the premises. \n\nMy philosophy as a host is to provide as much privacy as the guest would like, while also being always available as I live in another section of the house.  \n\nI love being an Airbnb Host as it has been a very happy experience to meet (or text with!) such delightful guests, and it has allowed me to continue living in this wonderful (and unfortunately very expensive) neighborhood.  I have lived in this house for over 25 years, raising two sons, and now it feels very natural to share this great location with travelers from all over the world.  \n\nMy favorite activities are hiking in the surprisingly scenic surroundings of DC or spending time outside gardening.  I do spend a good deal of time on my computer as I’m a website designer with a home-based business.   \n\nI love to travel and I've lived in France and Russia, starting out in both places without speaking the language so I know what it's like not to understand what people are saying.  Eventually I became fluent, and then mostly forgot it all, but the lesson that stayed with me is that people can always find a way to communicate.\n",

It's been a very stressful time, but as I said to Erika, living there felt like being on vacation. \n\nThe master bedroom and bathroom are wonderful, the living room is super cozy, and she even made it possible for us to host a friend who needed to come to town for a funeral at the very last minute. \n\nWhat's more, it's in a cozy little house right next to downtown Bethesda, which means you're always a 10 minute walk away from 1,000 fun things to do or eat. \n\nI can't recommend this place enough. And if having a full kitchen instead of a kitchenette is a deal-breaker for you for some reason, you should make an exception if it means staying with Erika!",

De kids konden prima met z’n allen op de grote kamer en wij met z’n tweeën op de kleinere kamer. Prachtig ingericht, van alle gemakken voorzien en alles was brandschoon! \nVanaf het verblijf konden we makkelijk richting DC (we hadden een eigen auto die we op haar oprit konden parkeren) en hebben we genoten van fietstochten door het centrum en langs de mall. \nMochten we ooit nog naar DC terug komen, dan zouden hier zeker weer boeken. Erika, hartelijk bedankt!",

Erika has obviously put a lot of thought into all the special touches in this home…comfy beds, super soft towels, snacks, coffee pods and tea in the kitchen, lovely artwork, a basket of doggie supplies for our pooch, super sized washer and dryer with laundry pods, etc. Erika lives on the premises and was responsive to all our questions and was very friendly and easy to work with. The place is spotless. The home is located very close to the metro, as well as many good restaurants and is on a beautiful, quiet street. We hope to book this place again when we visit Bethesda…thanks again, Erika!!",

The large table that seated 12 was ideal for family meals and games. The wi-fi was strong and available throughout the home. Laurent was quickly responsive via email, and his neighbor/friend Steve was available on site if we needed anything.  This home is a private residence with personal art objects throughout.  We respected Laurent's request for certain personal objects that were off limits to guests.  The deck and large yard are also lovely and accessible. The yard amenities, as the trampoline and deck furniture, were much enjoyed.  \nWe definitely recommend this home for those who prefer a convenient, modern Bethesda location with a large, well-equipped kitchen, great room, private bedrooms with en suite baths, ambiance throughout the property and easy parking.",

The kitchen was great, and I really enjoyed eating my breakfasts out on the deck in the mornings. I was also a fan of the gym in the neighbourhood. On top of everything else, Vera was really friendly, and made me feel very comfortable throughout my stay!",

The host was very kind and responded fast. The kitchen deserves a special praise - very, very well equipped. Oh, and Chuchie left us welcoming treats which came very handy! Washington DC was very easy to get to and quick (under 17 min), and you cant find a stay like this in W DC for this money. Very grateful and very happy. Highly recommend!",

I don't often meet my hosts so it was nice to talk with them about their hobbies/interests and their beautiful home! \n\nThe room is on the top floor and can run a little hot at night - I let Peter know the next morning and by the time I returned there he had placed a box fan running up there to help cool it down. The Queen Charlotte bed is extremely plush and too soft for my back, so I will likely stay in another room next time, but the room is comfortable, bright, and has a desk for working. The bathroom is very tidy and clean with extra shampoo, conditioner, and soap, and I had it to myself during the stay. Shower pressure is great, as others have commented.\n\nI'm looking forward to staying again!",

The house is in a beautiful neighbourhood and within walking distance of the Metro, so very convenient for downtown and airport, etc. The bedroom on the third floor was very comfortable and quiet & the bathroom (shared with one other single room) is right beside the bedroom. Everything was spotlessly clean and the shower is great! Breakfast was a real treat including delicious homemade bread, homemade blueberry muffins and top notch coffee! Peter and Genie are really welcoming, friendly and helpful hosts who accommodated a late check-in, and then changed our bed linen as we’d forgotten to mention feather allergies when booking! Peter even dropped us to the station when we were leaving as we had large heavy suitcases. Description and pictures accurate. Would absolutely stay again whenever in DC - an exceptional AirBnB! Would give 6 stars if we could!",

    "summary": "This bedroom is located on a separate floor, and is very quite. There's plenty of workspace for the working traveler and a recently renovated, modern bathroom. There is another bedroom across the hall, which is a mirror image of this bedroom. It has an extra-long single bed in it. It is not offered in this listing, but it is also available. See listing: \nhttps://abnb.me/IF1GWSf4kM\n\nAlso, there are two additional rooms on another floor each with double beds. Please inquire, if interested.",
    "space": "We live in a very walkable neighborhood and its historic designation comes from the fact that in the late 1800’s, it was among the first planned communities where people would live outside the city and commute downtown, via the streetcar, to work.",
    "access": "It’s our home and we’re very nice people. You’re welcome to enjoy it with us.",
    "notes": "We're coffee people with a commercial grade espresso machine (3 group La San Marco). If you are, too, and your schedule permits, I would be glad to get your day going with a nice cappuccino. Our breakfast is a delicious combination of homemade bread, homemade granola and (often homemade) yogurt served with fresh fruit.",
    "neighborhood": "We are located in the Historic District of Chevy Chase Village, a community of unique houses built in the late 1800s and early 1900s.",
    "transit": "The Metro Red line is approximately 1/2 mile away; Downtown Bethesda is approximately 1 mile away.",
    "interaction": "We are lifelong Washingtonians and willing to share tips for getting around, exploring DC and places to eat. I also realize that you may not have come to DC to spend your day chatting me up. ;-)\nWe are friendly natives, too.",
    "house_rules": "We're pretty easy going people. I think reasonably and politely would cover the \"house rules\". We do ask that you don’t eat or drink beverages in your room.",

The two beds are amazingly comfortable, the sheets of high quality, and there are various types of pillows on the beds, so each person can easily find the one they need for a good night's sleep. The AC in the house works perfectly, albeit a little noisy in the master bedroom, but it's like white noise and puts you to sleep. The outside area is wonderful, and at night magical with the cute lights. However, the property sits underneath a direct flight path to DCA, and at times it can be a plane every two minutes directly overhead, which is very noisy. You can also hear it early in the morning, so if you are a light sleeper, it might wake you up. Other than that, the place is wonderful, and Jenn was extremely quick to respond to any concerns we had. We also had an amazing check-out time of 4PM!! Where can you get that? :) Thank you, Jennifer!",

The home was beautiful in a quiet neighborhood and was within walking distance to town. As well as being beautiful, the place was very clean, modern and had nice bedrooms and bathrooms as well as a gorgeous kitchen that looked as if it was newly remodeled. We would highly recommend this wonderful home. Thank you for a memorable stay.",

The third floor had two beds and two baths. Perfect for the three of us. There is a great restaurant/coffee shop right down the block.  There are public tennis courts, bike share and a park nearby.

  "description": {
    "summary": "Our fully renovated townhouse is in the Georgetown/Palisades neighborhood of Northwest DC. It’s within walking distance (less than 1 mile) to M Street/Georgetown Waterfront and very close to Georgetown University & Hospital. Easy access to downtown DC, VA & MD. European Market is just down the street (great for coffee & pizza), Jetties is around the corner (great for salads/sandwiches), and the C&O Canal trails are close by (great for biking/running).",
    "space": "Our stately Federal-style townhouse is a 2-3 bedroom home with 3 full bathrooms. Renovated in 2013, we have a fantastic open floor plan, great layout for living/entertaining, high-end appliances, and hardwood floors throughout. There are 2 huge bedrooms on the top floor (with a King Bed and Queen Bed), each with their own private full bathroom. The first floor den can also serve as a third bedroom (Queen-sized air mattress and comfy sectional couch), along with a gas fireplace and full bathroom. There are beautiful French doors that access our deep fenced-in yard, complete with patio, Weber grill and wood-burning fire pit. Parking is available in the driveway or on the street. As this is our primary residence, please note that there are personal belongings in the closets and drawers, and groceries in the fridge and pantry. However, we have done our best to make room for our guests!",
    "access": "Everywhere, except the one-car garage (which is being used for storage).",
    "notes": "We prefer to host couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.",
    "neighborhood": "The Palisades is known for its tree-lined streets and small-town character. The area is predominately residential, but MacArthur Boulevard is the neighborhood’s commercial strip. It is lined with restaurants and shops, and it’s very walkable. This part of the city really doesn’t look like it’s part of a city at all– it really feels like a small town tucked away in a beautiful natural area. The people who live in this area don’t necessarily look like many other DC residents either: the Palisades is home to an overwhelmingly culturally diverse population, with a lot more families with young children and pets than you’d see in other neighborhoods.",
    "transit": "The Palisades is served by Metrobus lines D3, D5, D6, and M4. For those driving, renting cars or using Uber/Lyft, the Key Bridge is close by — leading to the George Washington Parkway, I-66, and Route 50 — and driving to downtown DC, over the Potomac River to Arlington, or up to Bethesda is quite easy. The closest Metro train stations are Rosslyn (the first stop in Virginia for Orange, Silver and Blue Line trains and is a major stop for Metrobus Route 5A to Dulles International Airport) and Foggy Bottom-GWU (located on the George Washington University campus, this station sits under the George Washington University Hospital and is walking or biking distance to the Georgetown/M Street corridor).",

Very grateful for her going above and beyond with getting us an outdoor fire pit with wood neatly stacked, privet grill access, new vacuum cleaner, and complementary bottles of wine.... just to name a few. Wonderful location. Felt safe. All the amenities provided. She’s a very sweet lady and an exceptional host. So happy our paths crossed!",

The hospitality shown by her was great. She is a very friendly,  experienced, systematic, and organized person with so much knowledge about the place and the surrounding areas, and guided me very well to explore the nearby places. Kristin's place is located in a beautiful landscape with a peaceful neighborhood. To tell about her place, it is a beautiful well-designed house with well equipped modern kitchen, bedroom, living area and very clean bathroom.  She offered me all the required kitchen equipment, cooking ingredients and also taught me how to use those. Overall, the stay was pleasant and I loved it. I wish to come and stay again in her place.",

We love antiquing, traveling and spending time with our three children, their significant others and our grandchild. We love hosting guests and friends at the inn and sharing our love for Aldie when they visit. At the Inn, a full breakfast is included in your stay, we use local meats, eggs and serve everything from French toast, to quiche, to Dutch apple baby. The Little River Inn features beautiful rooms decorated with antiques, quilts, hooked and braided rugs, spool beds and 19th-century paintings. The Main House features a sitting room with a fireplace, a patio, porches, two breakfast rooms and a spacious yard our donkeys, Milo and Racer, call home. Located across the driveway from the Main House, the Patent House and Log Cabin are free standing cottages that feature full baths and living rooms and working fireplaces. We serve a full breakfast at 8:30 a.m. every day, prepared from scratch by chef Tucker.\n\nEstablished in 1982.\n\nAfter moving to Aldie, Tucker learned that his great-uncle’s house was for sale, though the buildings were in poor condition, he decided it would be the perfect Bed and Breakfast. Tucker restored the Main house and cabins, while keeping the charm of the historic property, welcoming the first guests in 1982. ",

I did my research and wrote daily in one of the cozy and elegant living rooms. My backdrop was a warm fireplace and a beautifully lit Christmas tree. I was able to take a walk and enjoy nature in the wooded neighborhood. The hosts, Sharon and Quinton were beyond accommodating and professional. Each morning I was served a five star breakfast and in the early evenings I enjoyed the wine hours. The wine selection is vast. Leaving was difficult. The hosts truly enjoy having and serving their guests and it resonates in all they do.  I highly recommend this lovely upscale  bed and breakfast. I will be back, for sure. Next time for a romantic getaway.",

Breakfast was top notch, the stuff of DC brunch legend. The neighborhood was great for an outdoor run! The backyard allowed for some staring at the moon while enjoying a nice fire and whisky! It was a really great, relaxing, and refreshing stay! I enjoyed all of the touches and amenities from snacks and wine to candles and housekeeping. Can’t rave on it enough, as it was also my first bed and breakfast experience. Very cool! May be hard to beat! Looking forward to staying again the next time I need a little retreat from the city for a few days!",
